and i was otherwise , i &apos;d say you &apos;re seeing this .
he called them : &quot; massively fatal <unk> , &quot; which means they could kill 100 million people over the next 50 years .
until recently we didn &apos;t even know how a vaccine did .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re a huge triumph of science , because it &apos;s the automatic death death sentence for those who have access access to them .
but you know , the research that has happened to hiv has been helped us to other diseases .
this was a slow process , <unk> process , which was dependent on , millions of living chicken eggs .
and the ranges of the radical <unk> production and the vast <unk> of the e. coli for example , you know , look at the time -- that would be <unk> .
so the challenge is full of the challenge .
the question is just : why ?
do you think african union will organize a conference ?
there &apos;s some things that you have to know .
the speaker who was sitting on the stage , <unk> mohammed , <unk> on that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by taking the people from their <unk> people .
traditionally the africans hate the africans -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
it &apos;s not getting the help of the government , and it &apos;s a second , <unk> boat .
something that would all of us to connect us .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re over to be tipping this balance because they &apos;re going to click this first .
it &apos;s supposed to be <unk> to new ideas and to strangers perspectives .
and the man answered , &quot; well , beautiful <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for other bad news -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now i &apos;m going to show you a new material for possible solutions .
and to the <unk> , it will be an update on version 2.0 , where you can then <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
again , again , all republicans here , it should not go to <unk> .
so , what i &apos;m really impressed to the gulf , that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there actually is no one , besides a few people trying to use the beach .
we have heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> swim swam across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they dropped at least back .
what the <unk> of the birds are , i don &apos;t want to have a <unk> party of people who clean birds .

it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right , &quot; i am more than my genes , &quot; all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to be it because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a neurotransmitter .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human <unk> .
now , neurons , as well as well , can grow new branches and they &apos;re losing old branches .
and we can even talk about the <unk> .
if you celebrate that number , it can easily be a huge potential for the <unk> in the brain .
perhaps this technique will be able to know ourselves through both and and put together our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on video videos and commercials with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment here to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did it , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a giant scandal a couple of weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is unbelievable .
then he found this wild , this wild plant , the <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try before i was .
no salt , no fruit , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell is that ?
at least , i &apos;m not . i think it &apos;s .
farmers who are leaving the nature to find answers , rather than nature solutions to the other solutions .
and to change the new fire , is , two great stories about oil and electricity to change the two one-fifth of the fossil <unk> in the air .
our fuel for mobility is at three fifth of cars .
you can make it safely , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or more advanced biofuels .
also better light and <unk> and so on the <unk> , to a third .
so , in about 20 <unk> , private <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> solar panels and lower financial losses on their roofs and lower their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re also replacing it , it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- although we buy more of them , or a new nuclear power , called <unk> <unk> , or renewable , which are more or less integrated .
so , so , the results , and not incentives , to focus , <unk> and conflict to the <unk> solution to the u.s. states .
and i realized later , i realized that what i ate , two <unk> of his family were true .
this simple <unk> shows that the donor is in areas where the least kids go to school , don &apos;t have schools , and this makes new questions on the world , because aid is the ones that you need most ?

they come from families , usually the only person at home is , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their own .
we bring them to the right and left to turn to understand and the consequences you know , when you squeeze orders .
let &apos;s go all online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; well enough for <unk> .
then you can support us . this is the job of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and raise .
take for example , we take the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about wikipedia , where everybody &apos;s at the content , and at the end , you &apos;ve made the largest encyclopedia of the world .

science on the one hand has a very rational approach to its environment , while art on the other side , normally an emotional approach to its environment .

and most of the time i take away from , even though i am a <unk> <unk> .
look at the data that &apos;s available .
now , our mobile phones are now going to be a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on it , where they live .
this is my grandfather .
for the simple reason nobody &apos;s talking about it .
as the beginning of the beginning , they move plants from water from water .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of nature , &quot; nature &quot; which is <unk> the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent take a percent of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that is the <unk> uses some of the <unk> , which we &apos;re going to address the world &apos;s world .
and he was a called <unk> <unk> : he was thinking of all the <unk> and mutations to find rules , to look at the norms .
and in this case , you can see that the individual stages , but they repeat it without being <unk> .
as an architect , i think of relationships between the parts and all over the product , but it &apos;s always more a matter for business .
we &apos;re <unk> ourselves on the level of the building of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they all all the on the <unk> floor to a single mass mass .
and come back to a few years later , 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see that this landscape actually looks like <unk> as a rainforest .
the difference is in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been discarded and now on the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers , the huge problems of water water , rivers , lakes and even seas , and it &apos;s the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can get that and there &apos;s opportunities .
irrigation is the largest <unk> of the <unk> .
work work .
so , what is this system in system that is ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system system is not tax .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological amplifier to enhance these <unk> -- muscles .
this is what it looks like this .
here we &apos;re <unk> , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the mountain , and then other pristine records we had our <unk> -- signal . two other , that we have our hand , and the signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode inside it and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and this is our goal -- something more clinically <unk> to have .
this is jesse and he puts a <unk> .
so thank you .
in fact , in the africa , largely , there was 22 million people living with hiv , that are the valued 70 percent of the 30 million people are infected globally .
governments in the place to be effective , effective , to create ethical aspects in clinical trials , which are authorized in the different developing world . <unk> , the government and the <unk> of the study .
the basic problems we &apos;re confronted are , are a too high consumption and too many people .
so you can all the criteria that they would like to people .
so you see this electricity , which goes to north -- the <unk> in this case -- the way to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
we also know that not only are the <unk> threat , but as the same as the magellanic magellanic world .
so i want to show you that penguins are moved into <unk> .
turbo has <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ll let it in in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes very comfortable with it .
well , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of a long frontier .
again , like in mongolia , in mongolia , china lost russia . it &apos;s <unk> .
for low-income countries , china has reduced its <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia , and it was cheaper to be able to sell them to china and <unk> to china .
what i &apos;m going to introduce you here , i call it <unk> day day day .
these two arrows form a arc , a fence of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west to the gaza to the gaza to the gaza .
most of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what about the future of the european union ?
53 countries and far the most of the butler , are straight lines on the map .
this dream is the old .
does it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes the growth .
so , how can a hormone , at the end of aging , the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones , which are particularly under the conditions that are active in the circumstances -- when food is available to be available , and not a lot of stressed in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on the lifespan of people .
and basically , in principle , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i &apos;ve talked about , which is going to be very quickly , a different normal <unk> , like , like a bird , so the bird can live much longer longer .
you will never see a way that this is a display because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk through a <unk> .
this is what this is a lot of <unk> <unk> , how prozac essentially the chemistry of the brain , as if in fact , the brain is the brain of chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague , seymour <unk> thinks that &apos;s too .
so , by the <unk> , we found that a beaver , a lot longer longer , and when we <unk> the genes that we were playing in this mutation , we could discover a <unk> .
this question has been asking for a long time , but we can actually test it .
or so , mosquitoes in the dark , by telling us <unk> . they smell us .
just you can see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people have even told me that they &apos;d like to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> look at the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes .
and as <unk> , is fat is one of the best sources for adult stem cells .
while we &apos;re talking about clinical clinical studies to study using using stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela &apos;s the entire world .
so what happens when what happens is that what doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see , what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i left the headline .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about before .
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers with materials that &apos;s encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wing , it &apos;s <unk> , but it can &apos;t really be , there &apos;s the fly between two <unk> .
for a smart creature like our fly , these don &apos;t actually set up into stone , but changing as the animal learns through experience .
so many of these experiments were able to be able to be the identity of the critic &apos;s identity of the critic &apos;s the 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and the artificial intelligence , how to do that , but we still haven &apos;t even have one example of how intelligent behavior from the physics of physics interactions on living matter .
so here &apos;s libby , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : : yeah . tb : okay . a little bit , please , a little bit .
i know , of their own experience , i know that the hospitals can be a very much more difficult place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite favorite from legacy .
one of the one i say you , this kind of <unk> , which is all of their goals to their genes , the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health in health in health in health .
they don &apos;t stick like velcro or <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you climb on the underside of the <unk> , and we would get a <unk> , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , <unk> did . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , very different than you would see it in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say people who work in the oceans and think about the goals , we &apos;re the way they should be much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
when this ice melt melt down , sea sea is melting down .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the the galapagos islands .
their relationship is the water .
but then you end up at the end , they look at the black .
we have very interesting opportunity to the co2 as we have in the atmosphere , millions of years , we &apos;ve just been doing it with <unk> , but in this case , we go 20 million years back .
and this is the task that einstein asked : to figure out how gravity works .
einstein has already space , and time , warps and curves to the gravity .
but deep into the fabric of the space , so the idea , could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just like the strings of a cello different , the pieces of threads can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this only an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two panels with colored dots here .
now , can see the predator &apos;s predator , which is what they &apos;re attacking ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information , generally generally generally make information .
and we look at about 30 seconds on what a pretty hammer is in a 18 minutes .
why ? because when the one in this shadow , in this shadow , and the same amount of light on your eye , like the one on the ice outside of the shadow , they would have to reflect more -- just according to laws physics .
where do you know that ?
and it comes into the beehive , there &apos;s a blank <unk> and gives it -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . awesome , right ?
do you vote ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right there or wrong .
in 2010 , in 2010 , in 2010 , in 2010 .
we are also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of safety , the risks , the risk of the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we are confronted with .
think about cancer , avian flu , swine flu .
there was no new insight , but less frightened .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it <unk> by trying to accept data to our <unk> and data to accuse the <unk> of our <unk> .
i &apos;m familiar with another group , to determine if my plane was safe to fly to it .
this is the people .
and he was found here in the near , at stanford .
they had good tales with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anybody to do , any one to get them to get them or save them as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first stage in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky .
and groups were very often called terrorists . &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process , which the core of this very complicated society can deal with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably in the first time in the world &apos;s history of the arab world , a <unk> <unk> .
paradox is that the <unk> was so promising for the very promising , for a main reason .
suddenly , the ngos called their slogans , not just on the streets -- but they were taking them in negotiations , to part because they <unk> the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was a very smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big <unk> . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun comes out , they come right to the boat , it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;ll give you a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you some radical things about how we &apos;re supposed to think differently about cancer , a lot of people who contains about cancer a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , by just comparing the genetic resemblance .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good connected . &quot;
so we basically measure any <unk> than a own .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some <unk> of it .
where we really have to get up is the process that &apos;s just going on , and that &apos;s on the level of the <unk> activity on the level of the brain , the body doesn &apos;t even heal it ? &quot;
danny hillis : how to understand .
they all have members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people .
because , in stage three are most of us .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody did this .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s king &apos;s <unk> sentence .
so , i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , i &apos;m doing . &quot;
and suddenly they were getting out the <unk> , and they were trying to find out , &quot; how do we ask questions about the population of religions ? &quot;
and we automatically <unk> the little bits of plastic up .
these <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which was designed to make a lot of the control of the ground , where they are , they were not as permanent buildings .
they <unk> the stability and safety , the laps of an uncle can be comparing with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in high heels .
but from my perspective , compassion is a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t really .
stories like these , signs like this , are practical aid in a world that yearns for compassion , to be compassionate from the other of suffering that we could otherwise <unk> .
gandhi also was a really <unk> person .
and the first day , our <unk> came to us and taught us our motto , which we had to give up to the rest of the summer to bring the <unk> .
this is one of two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without instinctive the wisdom of the other .
so this is the world we live today .
and so i &apos;m going to learn from my grandfather &apos;s my grandfather &apos;s my own way .
okay , number two : go in the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to be a internal image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very <unk> circumstances , and my parents didn &apos;t have a secondary school education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that have happened is that we have today &apos;s opportunity today .
it &apos;s an initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve now uploaded 30 different technologists to 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people , to learn what this particular market needs and demands .
and my <unk> came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember , and i remember that every generation has to make better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and still say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started in 1980 with another family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibilities to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old ford as well as well as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he praying .
whether you believe or not , don &apos;t make it any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you hold in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , which they are .
when my kids were still small , i went into her room , sat down on her bed and i watched my kids to sleep at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i was <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet there &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , each with a different collection of 100 books that the village all of all around 10 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for <unk> .
you answer the question : how does it feel like to realize you &apos;re going to be <unk> ?
we &apos;re really really good for this really bad lesson .
think about a moment , how it &apos;s right to feel right ?
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with this , trying to find it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book about a subject that everybody hates , for a audience that never would be .
it &apos;s not only <unk> <unk> wheat , but mountains from grain .
in 1986 , they came from vietnam after america .
and the answer was <unk> , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank down to a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , we tripled .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know is the youngest democracy in the world is only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re very often at the west , and as if the happiness was the happiness that we would get to to capture , a thing , or maybe several things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- this is the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production , by doing the right conditions that our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under deck , you tell you the <unk> , you move , but the eyes are moving in the with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent silent . &quot;
amy , you ask up to the top ?
the way : what did you do ? the outcome : what did you see you ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should be a voice and to enable them to express this also , and that &apos;s why amy &apos;s the last word in this short story .
poor people have this opportunity to choice .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> doesn &apos;t actually hurt the way we &apos;ve talked about , but our society <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody who have already said , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how come up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis and i got a lot of attention , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight engines in this vehicle .
thank you .
they drop apart , they fall and they end up there .
i mean , people ask , if mobile phones are safe .
you have a concussion .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone his wife .
and for those who don &apos;t read it , it &apos;s like , &quot; it seems like this , it &apos;s actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , which is not <unk> , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the most sophisticated poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> death . &quot;
it was only months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold him on the life if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper , we have to redefine the hope and again again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he &apos;s defeated .
to give you this , we have to put them back to the driver &apos;s seat .
we <unk> the field , we put it , we put people in the building of the inside , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> , where the search and the rescue .
when i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details , in the opposite , i could write this story .
you get rid of the public opinion .
it &apos;s not very good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : that country &apos;s going to cut , china or india ?
because the indian man has been a advantage of the life expectancy , a <unk> advantage of two years .
what political change is , they have <unk> .
china , i think , has always been some of the , <unk> principles -- mostly in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that there are in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> and with various <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to afford to afford these advanced electronics in these countries , and now everything is <unk> .
one thing , a little chaotic environment , where you &apos;re probably made a lot of ideas , where people were more , interesting , interesting , people have been , people different backgrounds .
about a decade or two decades ago , he had the name howard <unk> , and i was reading darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they <unk> themselves in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think about it .
is that the other way the other way around ?
in the 1970s , this one percent of the u.s. income is 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
a lot of these political factors can be in in the category of capitalism , &quot; political <unk> , who help a group of good , but don &apos;t have nothing good for the rest of us .
and as you can just see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of the money , it &apos;s much harder to grade it .
and so they invest an unprecedented amount of time and resources to train your children .
we created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die from one .
this was a huge frustration for us , because we believed in a new development .
i think in places like oregon , where you &apos;re going to take your <unk> and to eat a toxic dose , only half a percent people have ever done it .
so long , long , long speech , they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most <unk> of the disease of our time , how did the good and the bad ones together ?
and some article went to this very far , that <unk> is resistant to cancer , and beyond cancer , but it &apos;s about metastasized in skeletal muscle .
<unk> percent , that there were these tumors tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what <unk> that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , can determine angiogenesis , the tumors that these blood vessels are capable of control that these blood vessels for themselves .
this is a very far idea of <unk> , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator was left me .
she was the girl that breaks the other for their team .
and i was a very same time , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia who had a 11 years son .
&quot; what did he said ? &quot; i asked the translator translator .
so they came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from korea to live , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open the windows , look out , and see , as flames go from the side of the hotels to the altitude . hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , they took towels , and then they were facing our faces and the children .
and the adoption is through . a year ! what &apos;s going to do so long ?
this is their <unk> .
this is sydney , in a few days three years ago .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s a planet , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets .
but there &apos;s more too much more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , or it &apos;s something that depends on each of the planets ?
and this deeper <unk> , the underlying point is that science is the way we know about to redefine the life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , all the galaxies , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look : whereas uganda <unk> and zimbabwe <unk> , russia would have dropped on one percent .
you find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it may be something else , which is what the more common .
we know that about <unk> billion people have ever lived .
it &apos;s not just a economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter time period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just like the institutions .
they just have to eat me . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end up with three questions on the future billion , in 2016 , when the united states is to be in the place as number one single economy in china .
no , we &apos;ll be able to push , notwithstanding the giant <unk> that we &apos;ve all , despite the signs of the signs that we lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical <unk> .
niall , thank you .
there are lots of spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider spider
spider silk is almost entirely made of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are already quite diverse .
and also , <unk> has a huge potential to their ability to be the <unk> .
what i &apos;m going to notice is not the <unk> , as lovely as it may be , but to the photos .
you have to have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
this sounds kind of <unk> in our ears , but what ended up is that 80 percent of the <unk> has contributed a lot to have .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem , the first goal is immediately , the first goal of the institution immediately is changing the journey .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to try to find whether bloggers journalists or not .
it &apos;s made by using their <unk> , and the use of many of these tools , and this is no doubt the u.s. troops in the world today for the last week .
you have <unk> , which is probably the most part of the <unk> part of bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just filled with fibers , because <unk> is made of fibers .
everything is at its place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s go back to the different steps , underneath the <unk> of the <unk> of the connections to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and when they &apos;re sort of , they go back to the way that they &apos;re alive and character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of spent spent every beer .
it will be a kind of <unk> while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it &apos;s very , very long , to write these scores , and i &apos;m working on a piece , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i &apos;m <unk> my hair .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> by brian <unk> , who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
so , this gives you a little <unk> of the play .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a dish with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , the last time , when we look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the look at the very <unk> , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer depending on us than the babies every other species .
the <unk> is bringing you to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that really interesting about it .
boy : so .
our consciousness is becoming extremely bright and vivid , and everything else is going dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and <unk> of the human species , &quot; says the <unk> alison <unk> , and their research , how babies and make a <unk> information and make decisions .
so if i just just just a little demonstration for a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeat this process , and again , and again , to get out -- in this case , the figure is to be like , like i walk straight .
what we really wanted , the whole human body was .
you can &apos;t do it , you know , you can &apos;t do it .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , as he did .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some new time , we use our software to do exactly that , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our <unk> in a few big <unk> .
we thought it just would just hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the <unk> , and how most of you hope you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity are absolutely essential for us to develop empathy .
if you ever , you &apos;re lonely , you write a new york times column , then you get hundreds of emails , and most of the things that i was doing today is <unk> by frustration .
some of those stories are just classic , but it &apos;s so .
it &apos;s <unk> . nobody has ever bought it .
there &apos;s a frontier that we don &apos;t yet , what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in the word -- that might be !
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were supporting by microsoft with an open-ended standard , instead of apple <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , if someone writes a <unk> , a day -- i say , &quot; kiss . &quot;
but when i looked at the most advanced technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the way , <unk> technologies , i made a lot of worry about the <unk> .
and to cut the danger of these new things , we have to limit the ability to the individuals that are basically the access to <unk> value .
i think the challenge we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is : are we going to be able to make these <unk> with the back in the background that is going to make us choose from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you &apos;re all kinds of unbelievable features .
and to give you a sense of the last of a little ambitious fund -- it &apos;s a <unk> million dollars , so it &apos;s quite considerable for us .
and if you &apos;re using the concept of the <unk> , you can make a much more effective value -- the value of the market -- to provide feedback .
so 12 years ago , i started fascinated , and i moved my research into this direction .
wonderful and gloomy things .
there &apos;s ice there .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
it &apos;s actually so much energy in this cave in this cave there is actually a large number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have a lot of traits that are used by people and other organisms used to be used as habitat .
whenever you get a destination , to its attainment , some steps to be taken on , some way .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
<unk> was made and it was suffered under tremendous <unk> .
so , before we could start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the electrons around light , they &apos;re going to fly .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> of <unk> had a son named alexander of big , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , institutions , they get <unk> and more than that .
the original <unk> was one of the most <unk> <unk> in the 18th century .
i was like , 160 dollars for this kind of thing ?
it has four balconies .
a schematic scheme is that many of these things are japan -- you will notice .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- you call my taste the one -- so it &apos;s not necessarily significant that i was not impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there , with this reaction .
and then the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold out of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what really interesting is really interesting about virtuality is that you can measure it .
well , i could develop a game with the name of <unk> , by just a million pies , you have to get a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is gorgeous .
and i want to tell you a quick story , this is this -- in 1999 -- there &apos;s a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological species that we get when we observe people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is called <unk> as a <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there are hunger in america , 49 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their plants are also big .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of <unk> grain and the big <unk> , by chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change in america and change in the way we &apos;ve addressed .
this is a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;ve got two years ago , and that was one of the greatest projects that i and my company ever involved .
but i &apos;m going to just talk to the beginning of the process , to three very <unk> .
if we &apos;re so good , what we do , we should not be able to create an architectural manifestation that would be perfectly safely through the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
and the architectural implementation was said , <unk> said , simple .
and this is the very effort to do it .
the second technology we used to do , because we &apos;re using things that you know from the <unk> of an opera .
here &apos;s the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk today about how to make stories , in some <unk> .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
this is the images that automatically created .
as as as i wake up , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a time that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if they were just a year , what would you do the next 35 years of their life ?
&quot; money deserve and a business , &quot; was the indian <unk> .
and he was told her he wanted to be in this , and he had a about <unk> chance of survival .
don &apos;t get me wrong , scripture has been very benefits .
and with hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then it &apos;s limited .
very funny , very funny , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do it in the way .
if someone saw in 1973 on a black board in 1993 , the <unk> had been a little different for the time of &quot; love story , but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week at the whitney , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
now , afghanistan is not an existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of optimism optimism .
diplomats are diplomats in <unk> .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was to the great part of our humility -- in the very careful fashion of our intervention .
rory , you mentioned libya , to the end .
so here you &apos;re looking at two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , which is <unk> , but when you <unk> these <unk> <unk> , this is used to a different type of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a very difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is valuable information to lead on a relatively bad thing .
so , i think it &apos;s the minimal <unk> that we &apos;re probably going to do to make things .
and we decided that we &apos;re not going to think about the cost of thinking , but what &apos;s about simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as you themselves .
so we can think about things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i say you can &apos;t believe in the hospital , if you have to get limb with a missing limb , without the previous <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
then bell bell , bell , he &apos;s then turn to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , the doctor trying to make a diagnosis , to the <unk> .
between the perception of the patient and the doctors in terms of the best medical care of the most real contradiction .
also a other experience i did in texas before i went to stanford , i was influenced me .

my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> , wrote the big bang .
and now they open your eyes .

my experience with the islamic world are very different .
so , there &apos;s a character .

and then , it starts to desire . this is curiosity , <unk> .
you know that there &apos;s a <unk> space that everybody alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s usually played in smaller spaces .
so , early <unk> are some places .
so i asked myself , ok , is this kind of model for design , this adaptation that we do doing ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; there &apos;s me on me !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring here to the language ?
albert einstein -- i just talked to a person when i was talking about , and i met a speech , and i met mr. einstein .

licklider foresaw the computer licklider computers can do the necessary to to enable insight and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by increasing sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer , and we get a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our sense .
these are the human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , which is what else was a task for 40 people over three months , to a simple task for three people in 40 hours . all of all are wins .
we should stop looking at out outside .

what you need to think is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was , why the entropy ever was ever low .
in contrast with low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to this , we have a good theory that can explain this , if this theory applies true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , even though the universe gets forever , and the ordinary matter and radiation , there are always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it lasts .
it &apos;s a <unk> of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never been using a computer yet .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .

our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotions in art , to the beauty of music at the night sky and our offspring , as long as the human race existed .

and this is what we &apos;re going through now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , more than mars , even though mars is a very much more nuanced and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s the kind of life that the kind of life that can live out there , it has been tremendous benefits compared to the life on a planet .
there was another object on the <unk> of these , and <unk> and naked -- pretty <unk> stuff for a little child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned them into things that people use to a new kind of way and perhaps a new kind of relationship .
the other thing that is <unk> is to <unk> , is that we decided all of gadgets , this whole <unk> , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example of all this in a room , the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the development of the brand , it &apos;s all interconnected interconnected .

is the internet actually a place to come to come to ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago when i started to , was there only a cable along the african west coast , this map of steve &apos;s beautiful beautiful as thin black line .
and that seems to me right .
this data is sent to layer by the device , starting with the basis of the product , and puts the material layer on layer by using the new <unk> in a <unk> process on the old layer of <unk> .
it was made by <unk> by about four <unk> of <unk> .
a consequence is probably going to be less .
you can just make it directly directly .
here &apos;s made the product .

and we don &apos;t have a <unk> , to use this as fast as we do it at the moment .
we &apos;re up there and we &apos;re looking at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab lab that we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i &apos;ve got to be bad poems , and he never had the <unk> in the air , but he &apos;s gone to cuba .

in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned to the simulation , and others who have learned in the fact .
when i say , &quot; we &quot; i mean the advice for <unk> .
but no one thinks that it will be very effective in fact when there is an actual outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending in the administration of bush is actually more than with anthrax and the threat through <unk> .
we know that the virus is going to be mutated , it will be another virus .

i &apos;m very excited to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have a lot of them , we &apos;ve been <unk> <unk> .
and in the other hand , in the other hand , the same bacterial infections have been not a problem .

because of the <unk> leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark and very quiet and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the most <unk> are interested in the dynamics of the <unk> , who live in the woods .
we &apos;re advising us with the media , we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .

he said , &quot; look , you know what you hid before you . &quot;
and so we &apos;re seeing a rising demand for <unk> , and that &apos;s why that &apos;s why .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
i learned two really important things in that day .
the more you can get under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started to know about 15 years ago .
and i breathed the air in the air , when the air comes out of the <unk> , the air comes from the <unk> .
so any of these computers can do the entire system , so if you &apos;re out there , there are reserves reserves .
but it looks like this , and this habitat remains , and it &apos;s still over a lot of miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people they are .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even know what family was going to be , and he &apos;s called him <unk> , because he looked like he was like he came from one of his books .
oxygen generates a <unk> and it <unk> .

we , we all of us are what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium <unk> long , you can start asking about their origins .
these <unk> evidence prove that life can exist in many other places .
so you have to be able to make the diversity and the incredible amount of life on this planet in the first step deeply to appreciate in a relationship with life elsewhere in all of them .
and so , by doing this , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the way aluminum , and we will expand it to 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive to 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive to the <unk> law of the intrinsic computing computing .
and then we would like to search the <unk> search for human health care .
a lot of say it &apos;s the best place to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
and as they <unk> the ice , you put a extra gloves in an oven so you can put a new couple , if their <unk> <unk> and their fingers are stiff .
i think this is a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
and our personnel are very happy to be the idea of pipelines in <unk> police station when they were actually listed for the service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can still take that , and efficiency almost triple the same amount of improvements and so the cost of the big <unk> .

according to his <unk> , &quot; he looked like , as if he was first discovered that it &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s on it . what &apos;s a good answer .
but how attractive they find them , how much they &apos;re being sexually or fuzzy , what you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has a value beyond what it gets to be , because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even if i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell , he brought his <unk> with a subway station in washington , and to see a corner , and see how much money he will take .

the <unk> is one of the most fascinating things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> conclusion when you &apos;re a drug in a such high dose , that it &apos;s more side effects , and that their new drug will be better .

you can try to imagine what if language is only being used as language .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it &apos;s working ? is it good ?
it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what &apos;s insight from that they won me ?
all these different rollers . can you imagine an argument about you to join , but in the audience and you see in the debate ?

what you can &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .

i have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , even <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i &apos;d like to use paper to <unk> it .
first we did it .
what does that mean ?
when i began to , with them , i realized they &apos;ve been incredibly well adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
and then they finally went to their degree and the campus -- and sure they were gone to come there -- and that was going back to come back and realized that crows still still reminded .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other things .
squirrel will come back for instance , go to the peanut and go back .
but there was three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;

intent -- a life with intention -- i think of the original things better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left <unk> , and i <unk> that they were lost , <unk> all the way i hadn &apos;t done , but i couldn &apos;t be able to do it .
then i started , like many times before , what my life would have been , if this man doesn &apos;t have been harmed me , if my genes have a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now despite a <unk> i , and i think , i guess , i was myself to myself .
i had a little bit simpler to hoped that <unk> <unk> to four words and to my way back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , his <unk> was a decade .
yes , contrast .
we work with the machine institute in the university of california , san diego together .
one of the one , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural <unk> form that interaction with the robot is more intuitive .
and i was going to own this idea .
after i realized this economic , i thought we have to find a solution to this problem .
some of these guys have the <unk> of the speakers , like to speak , and the one of tim ferriss who are being a <unk> .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that involves this .

i was a unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t marry me .
you can compare it to use dna and <unk> segments .
and so close to me , by telling me , i &apos;m going to tell you 20 people with schizophrenia .
it costs the defense in a case of two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
first , fighting it wasn &apos;t fighting the patent , but the <unk> .
and my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;ll leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why don &apos;t ? &quot; , the girls ask .
the fathers were at a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their hands , their chairs and their hand to dance to dance to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
you can &apos;t see the enemy of the time , and so , and so , and so , and so , and so , we were going to have a different way to eradicate polio than we had to smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic <unk> , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet the impossible is happening .
bill gates : where are bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we get polio
dj : we found these <unk> now in all sorts of animals , especially with the big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big .
and then we became a surprise , it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope that we accompanied us with our work .
it was incredibly amazing when it took it in safety to protect it in the hyena .
and of course , when i look at this <unk> , the <unk> , it reminds me a profound way to a human hand . and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect to each other as man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we have to continue to continue .
after all , it seems obvious that the earth is big and <unk> , the sun is small and cell , but it &apos;s worth to remember what <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s because there is that in middle america , the subway is always there .
nature of this model depends on the way we &apos;re .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between you don &apos;t have any consensus in terms of their favorite <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> and stuck .
people like treating as machines like scientifically and <unk> are very , but it &apos;s a <unk> of waste , if you want to guess what the question of the question is next to be next .
i was going to go on the <unk> <unk> at the ripe and age of 40 years .
so , above a cursor i &apos;ll control with my head , i allow me to see these <unk> video from the robot to to send the the robot in a <unk> press .
with help people like you can do this dream .
in oceanography , for example , this is a <unk> dictionary in the <unk> , by basically the <unk> of the dolphins that are spreading the dolphins .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
so there are some of some lessons that you can learn from it .
but we don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we tend to think of this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you can &apos;t speak chinese -- which is really sad when you think that this is the most common language on the internet .
what are you looking at ? maybe we should do it .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i be interested in ? &quot;
but there &apos;s all these different techniques that allow us to go out and look at its place to find its place .
they would bring wealth and secure , religious violence and make sure that states never <unk> terrorists .
and one of this activity is honesty .
what &apos;s this ?
i love this dish .
and the war , the 20 million people took life -- until today the civil war in the world .
<unk> sen , who &apos;s this guy , &quot; i &apos;ve got all of this money , but i &apos;ve spent all this time , the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have largely the same thing , i would argue with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized missile .
in contrast , general tso &apos;s chicken , which actually began new york city in the early 1970s , when i started to college in new york city , so ...
so what we see in 17th century , the <unk> search for medicine from <unk> , which is the same thing .
so people would really have a big <unk> .
when the <unk> started to become less , i was always more <unk> until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember to get a child on any line .
at 18 and 19 , i fell asleep .
and again , i &apos;ll get something <unk> and something <unk> .
so many of us is clear that it &apos;s going to be a lot to do a better world in the next few years .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , it &apos;s working . where worked the world with treatment of the familiar problems that have been made of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you make the impossible , you do it possible .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement to climate change .
and there was crying .
the <unk> is something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their <unk> to create a material that is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , like a chemical , comparable with technical fibers .
or you know , you know , beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture it .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissues .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that the power of the power and the round of applause and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him to help him some of the next choices .
what do i just do ? &quot;
in this one another , visible demonstration , watching ibm knight , a <unk> , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his audience and the other behaviors that are like to the crowd of it . works this thing ?
stanley burroughs , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> , and it accepted the <unk> and <unk> , that there are two number of people to be a only one of the two to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships to be a very <unk> groups ?
but there was a <unk> <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he may have been able to put this bug .
uh , my dad , a <unk> ?
it was his father , decided they needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility about the lives of others , despite his young age of 17 years , and also his fault , a <unk> <unk> , because his friends stayed , he kept his entire life .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> , and my <unk> , , i &apos;d like , and i was <unk> , i was <unk> <unk> .
i asked him , given the victims he had to have the the victim , he had ever been <unk> .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people we &apos;re today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> after the next <unk> , which seemingly the very good state .
when you go the forest , the boundary of the <unk> , you &apos;re <unk> the capacity of the <unk> , stable .
with the discovery of <unk> , fishermen , the <unk> great barrier reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is under the current <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , that clearly shows that there &apos;s no option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i really like the media .
this is a <unk> of a race from a race .
first , it uses a ancient kind of manufacturing , the <unk> and connected this with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technique of this time .
and through the process of sugar in black <unk> , i hired portraits portraits .
it was very large pictures , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially in a bad <unk> , very far .
and so on the back , a sequence is also in the chimps .
so we can ask , there are a universal differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of today &apos;s the genome of today .
so we can then ask the same questions , as a neanderthal , you know , how to get people in these people today ?
there are a lot of people who produced their own vision vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
and after my belief , the plane of my belief , the plane of the future is its own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> growing in a 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a <unk> , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t . but mostly they were extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and by the people .
they would be <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have the sense that research is to work with you really have a effect on reality , that they actually can prevent that experience that they actually have to do with this area .
then then pick up .
<unk> <unk> you in a rigid body , coat on the <unk> , poor <unk> on your <unk> .
they did everything that as we taught them all the same way .
and after the battle they bring these mobile books and do what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re doing wrong .
also people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a <unk> .
and she showed up on the left piece to tell me how the problem of this picture was , it was <unk> with the idea of being black .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i &apos;m going to have a new set of questions i &apos;m .
well , that &apos;s kind of a obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how shall we do that . &quot;
i think you try to get numbers to multiply .
so i said , &quot; how long have you have to deal with you before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their <unk> increased increased to be in 50 , to new delhi , to be a <unk> biotechnology .
it was 76 percent . when test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be da vinci .
this is a 10-year .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the <unk> side of the space , a <unk> of mirrors that became the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
so i &apos;m going to show you some snippets from some snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you can understand this .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i &apos;d like to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> , we have , and find out what the price of people would pay for it , so that they would have the vote .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it .
we destroyed two <unk> and 10 tv .
the little <unk> of it , to take away from its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a couple of the models that i work with .
and they &apos;re creating the tissue of <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
and they just try to fly , like the time to shoot an arrow of the <unk> end , and it was tough work , and boy , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even <unk> developments like <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university of the university of technology .
be careful , they &apos;re just looking like wood or like this .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go forever .
this is about two billion .
it &apos;s going to take for the estimate of about three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget the one that &apos;s going to be .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time we live in the human mind and machines can win .
i &apos;m very clear mass . where comes you from ?
it &apos;s too much that the way that the way in the world could be extinct in 20 or 30 years .
all the evidence of <unk> that is being broadcast from a virus .
i took the opportunity , and took a few samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and some samples from other parts of other parts .
it took him for the veterinarian and this one discovered a little bit of <unk> .
ultimately , it &apos;s a <unk> implication of the ability to share our cells and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone there .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason , why don &apos;t make us happy to make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not going to break when we &apos;re conscious of this <unk> .
but what we see in the 21st century is asia , which gradually comes back to harbor and over half the world &apos;s population to harbor and beyond half the global economy .
you could think of this as the privatization of the <unk> .
after 1958 , the soviets sputnik <unk> , it was like , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re in japan or new delhi , or <unk> , your view of china will be something different than if you live in beijing life .
and when we have strategies in which we get into a broader context of this , we &apos;re capable of doing this process .
how do we define our national interests , so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> of the amount of positive .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this is the typically the accountability of the peacekeepers to guarantee a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re more than one of them .
jobs for whom ? especially for young men ?
after the time , after the system , you can &apos;t even get real estate .
so , the supply of the dignity , the conflict , the way that conflict is .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has thought , and they call the climate change , the security and stability , as governments in the world are arguing about how to react .
it allows you to make more productive , so that they can afford the insurance themselves .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions when we feel able to plan to be a <unk> world .
listen to the other words , how chinese students are practicing by shouting .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and this includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , to try to try and make logically consistent , and we take the hypothetical seriously , , that , what is what it might be , as what is .
aunties saw people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a group of the concrete world .
and there said luria , &quot; at the north pole is always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you have it deserve , killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half circle .
it feels like i was in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me , you &apos;d degree to do .
he still is in the red numbers still , but chris made it with personal sacrifice , this film .
i am a <unk> of their <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious .
we were all mad on them , &quot; why are you doing this ?
it &apos;s going to be a lot of real , when you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve had the game all over the school for weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had essentially all 50 <unk> <unk> .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people announced <unk> jobs and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i was all three legs in the triangle , the three pointy triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> and this old plastic , this <unk> is very easy to <unk> in an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible , if you have a full piece of paper , <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or in a government school -- a leaf , a leaf , a leaf , a leaf , a leaf , a leaf , a <unk> , no glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a glue , no a
what we do is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little straw , which is , you &apos;re doing this two corners here , it &apos;s like a <unk> .
here are two magnet .
it was very , very , a lot of passengers on the ship , and you get bored , so the captain invited them to be on his deck .
at the <unk> conference , <unk> gupta , <unk> gupta , but amazing plans to transform waste into really , very constructed toys , and we can build kids in the way of the , as they &apos;re learning basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of the biology that they were sending out of clues .
and there are some examples of projects that are aware of the <unk> ecosystems .
and with a little bit , we can turn a space of traffic , it &apos;s going to turn space to people , and it connects people to bring back into the opportunities and <unk> waste into the occasions .
this photograph was taken by the day , and only a year later , it looked like this .
when you go seawater , the first thing is the <unk> is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to explore the people all the <unk> of the world &apos;s all the way . &quot;
i was looking for someone who &apos;s jewish because i was jewish and i &apos;m jewish and it &apos;s very important .
but the real thing was that was a lot of men who wanted to go to go with me .
very few of us have the ability to be totally honest with themselves .
he would like to travel , as it &apos;s not on a <unk> .
i was trying to be like <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> , you have to achieve a <unk> of 700 times , and nobody did .
most of them , <unk> are the average of 33 years old , not eight years , and when we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of the older adults .
imagine that , whose vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have even a lot of other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , that &apos;s also clearly improved , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to take this result , and it &apos;s in the context of a different set of <unk> , a group that actually have been the way in our society , a group that are made of people who are in multimedia-tasking .
so let me this step forward to a task that is called mental magnetic rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just let &apos;s just let &apos;s just the kinds of programs of the special case of the special case we look at .
so it was a big , very complex project that i wasn &apos;t even sure if it works at all .
now , wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of a precise , <unk> language and a large network of <unk> have developed capacity , can make a lot of the lines .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to go to the world and realize that certain materials are useful for certain technological problems and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited at discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that have successfully reproduce in particular relativity and and the general relativity and gravity and at least evidence of the quantum quantum quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i lost more relatives , and teachers who are me <unk> to hiv / aids .
they jump up . you wear red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she had no right to a estate , and automatically all of all my family , but my family had been right anyway .
and the day before the original ceremony we were excited , and didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was wearing sneakers , and this in a village that didn &apos;t even have a <unk> streets . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl girl , i would come back and do everything that they would ask for me .
if it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was responsible for it and punished .
while we &apos;re talking about a hundred girls will never be again again .
consumers , 72 percent of the american gdp , actually , like banks and companies are paying back to the <unk> in everyday life , themselves from obligations and risks that are us to free us to free us .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually <unk> and in the basic future of education , the future children of our homes .
<unk> is to be <unk> percent at cornell , to the president institute .
we &apos;re also seeing a trend too much risky tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhood , and the time , the child &apos;s their own .
we also watch a big <unk> .
the trend is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i got the question , i am the only one that does this ?
you could exploit them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories write , writing , and today i want to share with you a couple of stories about the art of storytelling , and also about some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could shrink , our hearts may be stunted , and our <unk> , if we &apos;re living too long in our cultural <unk> .
and i came up with the first time i call it , &quot; representative of foreigners . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no ride or <unk> . i &apos;m asked to ask why i do , but the <unk> between languages i &apos;m making myself reinventing myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was a huge deal to a huge deal , because i &apos;ve been prosecuted .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will be a happy story , and in my next book i write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to get the existing songs , cut them into little bits , and they put these pieces of them , they collide together and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are the rather awkward comparison of aging .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;ll sum up what it knows . <unk> <unk> : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol of his finger .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s the guardian newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of <unk> <unk> near the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to a understanding of the structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single core , with <unk> , the it circle .
this picture shows a galaxy , a <unk> , , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it &apos;s also the <unk> ideas of us , about our place in the universe and the value of our planet planet .
this is . this is home . we &apos;re .
and with each click and click , every click of the screen , we &apos;re like <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information everywhere in our way through the digital woods .
when our daughter put on the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; will make a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even be <unk> with this .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much , and i was talking to my 27th birthday i was going to talk to my 27th birthday , i would not talk to a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained with help of a friend who my sign my sign that i was john francis was that i was going to live through life , i was not talking to this , and that this would be the last time someone had translated my sign .
well , i <unk> my backpack again again .
i started talking to speak because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was given to every birthday of my silence , but never about my decision to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
and i found a little jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried i was going to be back to my back .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to the time in america , but my father died in hunger .
but i firmly believe that their gesture of love and care of the lives of joseph can save and have thousands of other <unk> , and still change the hope that have gone to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was a lot harder than i was expected to waterproof and easy to make an industrial <unk> of the <unk> of industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t work , we don &apos;t work for the society , but for privileged people , rich , government , the government .
and then the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in japan in japan .
so , i wonder , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born in utero .
so fetuses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken to the world in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it comes a mixture of the presence that are as individually and strange how the woman themselves .
why should malnutrition have malnutrition in utero to <unk> disease ?
you can also see <unk> , but also with other eyes .
this is a confidence in the <unk> system is essential for any kind of <unk> .
the audience will be on <unk> <unk> , which is a sense , but not with the one that &apos;s going on in front of their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it may be a smile .
you may remember the <unk> <unk> , ok , that time when the greatest deal of all .
if you &apos;re a high animal on the unesco , and someone says , &quot; what do you do you do for the strengths of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we launch a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t think that a role of strategy is .
and for me , all the music was .
now , when i use my software , the camera looks the <unk> , and the <unk> the position of the <unk> to the <unk> , and you have a whiteboard .
i remember that the poor had a little bit of a little bit of food -- eat , clothes , shelter -- they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a <unk> of shame .
now , since i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i was not even asked a donation a donation , which was what was my way .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us a way to get into what their dignity would be , a relationship , a relationship , a relationship is not one which is based on a traditional kind of a donation .
it &apos;s a very <unk> combination , a very strong combination .
now , it &apos;s still very , at the beginning , and it &apos;s tactile , for me very clear that it &apos;s only a vehicle , just a tool .
what does the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m turning to second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other life in the universe ?
so the answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see here .
here are photographs of me .
even the rate of the time , is doubling every 18 and every <unk> member of the <unk> , this is the <unk> law .
but what about you ? what will it be with you ?
you sail sailing in their saucer , and occasionally , you get people to do with these guys who their parents would not agree .
so we &apos;re interested in these things like this .
now , earlier generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology of <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
we can learn very much about it .
and i see <unk> from and try to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t leave anybody alone , even a minister .
and secondly , they tell us they had a <unk> gang , but some of the <unk> for the <unk> was .
and so far , our knowledge came to our ancestors in principle of adults , there are the fossils , the <unk> , missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> study the origin of humanity in the large ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn about our human being .
and if all of all the rules should be , you need a effective system to trial and <unk> , because we &apos;ve found everything in everything is in everything .
it &apos;s seen as high seas because the continent was <unk> <unk> except .
we need to work locally , but also the whole seas corps industry .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay numbers to do what i do . &quot;
that &apos;s a pretty good idea .
to say it clear to say , i &apos;m a journalist , no technologist , so i want to design a sketch of what the present and the future will look like .
and then , in the end , i think we all have to think about whether we want this reality , and when what it means for our idea of life , and for everything that comes from .
it looks like crude oil .
the symptoms of the complex are you that you have the strong and <unk> belief , the right answer , no matter how difficult the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times , to explain how it works .
of course we can .
and deserve a lot of money .
it &apos;s like the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and try . it &apos;s probably going wrong .
immediately immediately . &quot;
and i was trying to think it was always , but he could never have the presumption .
i &apos;m like , i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not evolving .
china is going to have done this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it gets ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to be -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than capable of transcending everything that comes to us .
and here they come to play .
and what we need to think is this : when you &apos;re going down into flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought , we can put it up to our children , but ask you to them .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what level of development is the cell .
this should be amazing thing to be amazing ?
all we have is <unk> .
you &apos;ll be able to focus your listening to your listening , maybe the sensitivity or <unk> can do a series of things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distance .
we should be this very inexpensive , simple <unk> , and no one to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this average .
we can &apos;t risk that the trust of their clients .
it only has 500 and have had 500 to get to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of a <unk> , full of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back to a week when they &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of the web -- the things that we &apos;re all talking about -- is <unk> something less than 5,000 days old .
of course , it &apos;s been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web is only 5,000 days .
so , if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to now is a <unk> , a human brain , if we look at the rate , it &apos;s actually six billion <unk> in 30 years .
now it &apos;s not like -- if you make a table and things in work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web , but they will be , you become part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the extended senses of machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to .
the last thing i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
thirdly , it will be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ occurred to the , that it was sun <unk> moon , and i was been prepared by god , and i was prepared for his <unk> .
these are the dead dead by <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes it all logically .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line .
this is a project that we just completed in <unk> for a huge array of <unk> that came right from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are developing .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas for education young people are doing .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is to his neighbors .
so , we would have to pay for school .
so we have a big brain , a huge advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story is the two brains . it may be a surprise , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this <unk> is very , very important to be there .
we &apos;ve learned to talk about the big brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , sometime once , we were all like animals , and then they don &apos;t . &quot;
these are men and women who are even in the night of the night sky .
of course , the <unk> monks have said that .
the <unk> , the post , on the sun , on the sun , is actually a <unk> line , which is the speed of light , which appears to the holy <unk> of machu , called <unk> picchu .
if you praying for the dead praying , they &apos;re doing this gestures , you know , the <unk> of the sky , you know their thoughts in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has <unk> the world that are the mountains and the home of the country , which is the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material that you all know is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic &apos;s white stuff .
i put it in there , you can fit in a hundred years , my body can back again without a sudden , to go back to the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of or <unk> , because you have to take many different alternatives .
first first , they &apos;re going into a special bottle .
i was a competition for four years ago , &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s still a lot of <unk> than all the speakers and all the ones who come to me .
and she thought about my work to mathematical models that should promote a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience don &apos;t appear -- from deep , cultural reasons they keep it for boring -- and find another pattern of a lot more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways .
if you toss a coin , you get a sequence of your head and number .
back to the secular <unk> , because of people you &apos;re doing uncertainty . uncertainty .
and only one percent of the wrong .
he <unk> : &quot; i suppose that one cot death in a family , the chance to have the one . &quot;
it &apos;s not as improbable as one in 73 million , but still quite unlikely .
the whole quality quality control , the <unk> effects on the industrial processing is , it &apos;s the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> has rescued hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of thousands .
a intelligent power outlet lasts injury because it &apos;s always from , until an intelligent <unk> realized .
however , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a term of <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
however , the <unk> itself can generate a very strong force , which never had ever been in the history of china .
so , in fact , chinese as the real medium as a real medium , not just as mere headlines .
how a great ted , isn &apos;t ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they really made more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more and more chinese , free speech and human rights than their <unk> , rather than a from america .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his <unk> removed from trying to determine the cause of the cause of the cause of the causes of the , why was the sound of <unk> and his skull on the pages of the pages .
cl : joseph &apos;s phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
when i &apos;m <unk> , in this <unk> auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this case , in the dutch story , my father has the <unk> stream in the <unk> stream .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their guns as the tools of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a gun
this program gets a shape and then then it spits 250 dna sequences .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the high school .
you can &apos;t let &apos;s &quot; you &quot; too . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in the two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolves in a meaningful way .
now , evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution used the next stage to create the next stage , which is the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of <unk> growth in the u.s. economy .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to get back to our exponential growth , a thousand dollars on computing , to the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to be able to reach the full maturity of these trends , and they have to appreciate how much the <unk> has made of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to that point .
you can blessing and <unk> with themselves .
they &apos;re harder .
they were from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s nothing here .
dopamine apparently , it &apos;s the fabric that &apos;s linked to <unk> .
and then we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so kind of friendly to post and to the resolution .
i mentioned in our little experiment experiment , you &apos;re a <unk> in the african <unk> .
september september is a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i wasn &apos;t as well as he , but we did it , <unk> n &apos; <unk> , <unk> , tracy chapman and bruce <unk> to a <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they said , again , &quot; the truth says , &quot; and we put us the truth .
musician and activist peter gabriel shares his personal motivation with the <unk> <unk> for human rights and shares stories of active <unk> .
so next next we asked us how do that do ?
he recognizes the problem , and it knows it , the dance is his <unk> , to get it to be <unk> .
the beetle climb a lot less rare on the pill if they &apos;re carrying out when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s play a <unk> and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to <unk> into this great adventure , right , is not entirely with my experience .
or : &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s next year to antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the vc is that you &apos;re in the entrepreneurs , invest in and lots of money .
and to the experience of the experience , a company or something -- that &apos;s not going to be a company .
there are no financially <unk> , which there was no problems .
from there they take them with -- on a solid , very good path , right from the beginning to end .
if i happen to know someone who &apos;s so this is this one .
no , they &apos;re not .
then give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working in a physical pattern .
it &apos;s all the way to be positive , positive , more positive .
so if you follow my ideas , you will have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . this is great to <unk> who they are and to bring emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you imitate something , you can have a effect on it .
and then when you have enough enough , you can click on one link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , in the last place as the culture that innovation doesn &apos;t believe innovation .
so as we think and behave , we make our <unk> break down .
we have a <unk> meme -- seriously .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very troubled .
our thinking is backwards .
through a change change , like transparency , change , like <unk> , and collaboration , collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on outcomes .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are going to be , the only way for us to get rid of the old <unk> , and to find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t just do it alone , we should make it together , and if we do that , and we can do the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria into a better .
the magazine magazine , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master <unk> took me with the <unk> , because the <unk> was at the time .
after i had her to a gesture of the <unk> , they were very -- i was accepted and i was working for about six months .
nine days ago i had a fire .
you know , you know -- all of stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we were doing <unk> <unk> , our homework , but where we were looking at the images of images like this .
this picture literally made in seconds after my baby , and i got it over to over .
rg : oh .
av : taboo : taboo : you don &apos;t talk about his miscarriage -- but i &apos;m going to talk about today .
the general belief is that every aspect of my life has become better since i was born and family &apos;s miracles .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to lose control in a wonderful way , what , as we think of our own life , very much sense , and what &apos;s totally gratifying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;ll start glenn glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s such a episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen this &quot; star &quot; the <unk> .
imagine , big , late <unk> to hear about how to play with my own , john <unk> walker shows how footage shows the fine and <unk> <unk> , and then you can analyze them on wings wings .
well since then , we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic , the longest <unk> in the history of this country .
but now a few months later , as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as you bite to bite apple without biting the face of <unk> , &quot; as somebody like , your insecurities can &apos;t hide yet .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand it until i met this guy , was very messy man who was <unk> <unk> and iron on the <unk> .
but interestingly also also also also also a future in which society is a few <unk> of capitalism , which is how to integrate the dna , which is the dna , which is the dna , by making things , and then those who work , <unk> and <unk> .
so i want to share with you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new findings that i &apos;ve been working on with the structure of the structure that they &apos;re talking about , and your tendency to save .
and when i want to talk to really , the <unk> , i think constantly thinking about it .
now , this is a <unk> theory .
squeeze this device , please , you can see this device , you can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasures in the future of the .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important is the ability to communicate beyond generations can communicate .
we talked about the teachers .
but i &apos;m against it as a hurdle , i &apos;m against .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was in the field of the <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> <unk> .
people and giraffes and and and birds and everything , the red line is going up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on more serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this flew last night at the party , and -- you can see how it &apos;s just <unk> , and you can &apos;t want to <unk> any <unk> you want .
and he was dissatisfied about how people people were the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he goes back to the village as a <unk> man .
and he needs to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and it &apos;s all .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we we made us . we assume that &apos;s feeling of a mother and a lot of these on all creatures in this meditation meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are the things when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and <unk> to others .
although the change in your perspective is something for other living beings , you feel that new quality in you , and it helps you as a model of it .
so the coffee cup is , or the cup with handle , one of the society used to get the public health .
interestingly , complexity is very high .
we heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very easy to know if you know how to read it .
well , let me just get with four <unk> remarks , one example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with detail , but in the lower right-hand corner , you &apos;re an example of what we have .
have you started to do that ?
and this is what happens to the things that &apos;s talked about , what our new kind of organization is , or better said , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always less in the position , it will be in collaboration with the <unk> .
so let &apos;s take in astronomy , which is mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be professional professional argument .
so it &apos;s going to be not going to be a dispute of two camps , but between these camps , there will be all interesting positions that are taken by people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to to take their <unk> and to put their <unk> and actually , and actually a team of it was to be between between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was was to thank for him .
but the truth is that life is right here .
so people started calling up and have the news to the way these this here .
he said , &quot; i am dressed as batman , to my anonymity , to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that didn &apos;t have a data , so that turned out to be a different town , and a new job had accepted .
and in the last 35 years , i was studying human behavior based on the basis of everything , <unk> , dopamine and something like to the <unk> .
some of you have it , and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases , because there was no violence under their ancestors , but my father &apos;s already .
they &apos;re like each other as much as you can possibly be .
and by the way , i get an e-mail tomorrow , in the way , we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be the least known .
so if you want to know , why the sky is blue , or that <unk> , you should be basically , with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve now got it -- -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve now got --
so , the comparison is that people in this room is the higgs particle .
but it &apos;s really like to be that with this theory of the physical <unk> to unite the big bang , a totally wonderful forecast . the model didn &apos;t have to make the goal that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
it created this civilization , this wonderful image of this wonderful image , and it allows to see the civilization from all of the .
another great insight came from a study of cornell , in 2010 , the <unk> <unk> <unk> players from the <unk> <unk> .
in a similar study in germany , researchers at an fmri , to measure <unk> and after they <unk> <unk> in the face of <unk> .
&quot; because the colors that they have to order , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; you know ? why ? were there more policemen ? &quot;
we built the bright <unk> that people , people from <unk> , to think they were to be abroad , when they were <unk> , to <unk> their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; belief that you can do , and you &apos;ve got it half . &quot;
all across port-au-prince and the <unk> stations for mobile phones .
one of the design is the technology &apos;s power in kibera .
by 2015 , it will be three billion dollars in the world .
in the shops of the environment , batteries and bread <unk> .
this is the flow of time in everything is embedded in the smell of a <unk> , in the <unk> , the <unk> , the world &apos;s rose .
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bears , i remember as a child on his head to cover his head , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen over again how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can choose those solutions , innovations and moments , the flow of time doesn &apos;t <unk> the flow of time , but to make .
my mother was <unk> .
in each other camp camp , they had to <unk> soldiers , who was the older brother , who was nine , take away from him to a child soldier .
and i should do it alone .
take something that you want to have , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> , because i don &apos;t <unk> my emotions .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is going to be about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why would that play a role ?
so theoretically , we can grow any organ from any cell .
this is the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
so , when the rotors with the same speed , is the robot .
and you can see how robust control is .
and he makes it , while he <unk> obstacles .
you take your neighbors .
this is showing that we double the <unk> , triple , more than we can bring them to form teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also find out where he wants to go .
i can feel that , but there &apos;s still so much , and i want to expand your ultimate horizon , consciousness is opening up and change your way on honeybee honeybee .
this has been a huge problem for many years , in the course of the late 1980s , the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a lot of different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
you don &apos;t experience that .
they take chefs for their courts . and the honey -- there &apos;s <unk> -- they use the honey to your bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying , they wouldn &apos;t do it .
okay , now , now , it &apos;s really the question : why is this ?
of course , we &apos;ve been , in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of <unk> to <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , many people were unaware of this fact .
in fact , not many of them , of course , our bread was not european invention .
and especially the meat and china is going to get the <unk> .
<unk> has been for most people , and here are not many farmers who are being bad , to pollute the environment , to be bad , to destroy the environment .
everything is all of it .
and so while i finished my bread , i &apos;m going to do it , and i &apos;m trying to burn the hands .
and also , it &apos;s got to hold for a long time to hold on the place where tools and materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyze and and we &apos;ve developed a new technology , and i &apos;m revealing quantitative <unk> .
because i hope that you &apos;re going to take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is about last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them , and shekhar kapur , a film about her , <unk> queen , who should see them .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is <unk> <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient , which was in the time in the time -- it really needed a bypass , but it was a <unk> , but it was .
i like this slide , because you can talk a talk about what people really gets to change and what don &apos;t .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat even more fat because the , even more carbs . so the <unk> is lower , but the actual number higher , but the goal is to reduce them .
one of the <unk> <unk> studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged at the , 65 percent of people had bad breath , the <unk> , that &apos;s not healthy nutrition .
on the other hand , everything is a <unk> , <unk> .
i hope he doesn &apos;t hang on .
the film is based on a <unk> of f. scott <unk> .
two <unk> were in the project , warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to do the technology and technology to happen .
so we we put on the motion capture .
the number of infinity seems to be infinity .
and that &apos;s the data that we get from that , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished image was used in the film .
this was a very , very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the middle of the state of karnataka .
and it &apos;s got a own <unk> .
people are going to be the <unk> , <unk> past , and they lived for their lives for their lives .
we were to <unk> -- two of them as a driver -- and imagine , this is a big ocean of sand , 40 degrees , a water bottle .
i think that &apos;s the best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so let me show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> to my body temperature 40 degrees , enough to fry an egg on a <unk> .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
start a meeting with a poem . this would be an idea .
but how would you like it , if you never know how to the next day , whether you live a living in the world , their shoulders in the clouds , or whether they &apos;re just floating straight straight away from the wallpaper just straight straight away with their little <unk> ?
who could sleep sleep in this night ?
but you knew that judy <unk> the <unk> of the film was that <unk> <unk> the french army had to cover the french army -- no , i mean , i mean , he invented the calculator ?
and at the end , they sat down in a tree and a <unk> hand to others .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but it would be the two columns , probably probably not more .
and we also have the elephant , we have to make the problem that you can &apos;t build a construction that would be a very difficult .
one component is the understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other and sharing . &quot;
so now we &apos;re now looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s comfort .
that the test doesn &apos;t make good for it .
there &apos;s a very simple task to do it .
a philosopher wrote us that it was impossible , that monkeys had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely kooks , it &apos;s not two kooks , three is a lot and lots of possession of possession .
the last decade i spent my pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i heard in , in a sense , it was a success .
over the years , the <unk> can create serious <unk> .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life of me almost killed me
and i think that a lot of <unk> have this vision .
one really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they have <unk> , but they &apos;re not all the story .
ask , you know , the story of the story that &apos;s not being told .
a priest ?
but the last one group , they think that the indus people are the ancestors of the people in today &apos;s <unk> .
on the right on the left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , more data that &apos;s then <unk> .
this sign is the most common typeface typeface , and only in this text .
it turns out that in india has been known for a long time , names on the basis of <unk> at the time of the time .
space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire <unk> <unk> the <unk> bell , and the name bell famous .
jansky , the historic discovery had made that bodies as as <unk> , waves can be able to be able to get rf .
it &apos;s actually all the young people in the city .
somebody who sits in the seat next to you -- that &apos;s fine , you &apos;d sit on a <unk> , and someone would be so close to them , and then they would <unk> .
the dalai lama would like to say , if you &apos;re in his mind , it &apos;s because you realize that you and your pain and and and they &apos;re a little of a certain kind of thing for your own .
but take this wonderful thing that gave us to us , and they were afraid of the <unk> .
a man in front of a tank was a picture that was a symbol of the world for the whole world .
but what would you have not even able to do anything when they had the modern communications to make a sense that was wrong , and that was the wrong that was there , instantly had to be done ?
combine the power of a global ethic with power of our ability to communicate on global level , and to organize the challenges that are now in green and the largely global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children &apos;s the <unk> of the life that were left as the <unk> of rwanda , a million people died .
here &apos;s the task : help me to build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
you can move on very different <unk> , they vary in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> algae .
boy : <unk> .
so we slow to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky , at stanford , one of my partner , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technique called <unk> deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition deposition , which is the <unk> can be <unk> directly into an artificial foot .
they look like from aliens , and the secret to stick , they &apos;re their toes toes .
here we just pull the band-aid .
these <unk> structures allow the spines , <unk> and the <unk> , very <unk> , difficult surfaces .
so , <unk> long , beautiful songs , as a <unk> and males and men as females will enable each other and to choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet from each other , they have to generate less than half the time of whistles .
when we think about marine marine marine as we think , we have to be able to follow our own the consequences of our interventions that we thought was safe .
after the <unk> , the internet has made these systems to learn about what scientists could hear .
they &apos;re just listening to the low frequencies .
if males and females , if you use this signal to find a partner and they are scattered , imagine what implications would have been doing the recovery of the number of species .
how ships made <unk> , they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of this noise to be reduced by 90 percent .
they &apos;re <unk> the speed by 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 miles , and it &apos;s increasingly , and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all options available .
we &apos;re seeing a continual increase in the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s a hundred , obviously , the hundred looks .
with initiatives like the 100 laptop laptop , it &apos;s me to think that we can introduce a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computers .
thank you .
i think there &apos;s nothing that &apos;s the problem .
our daily lives , but , <unk> said , in a remarkable state , we &apos;re going to be in a <unk> .
it usually is one or two per year .
and there you are .
but we &apos;re a lot of more diverse .
one of the challenge was to try and rhythm and space , i don &apos;t just juggling my hands -- juggling is a lot of <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they &apos;re mad .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i give you a little hint of reference .
now again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
you have here at the top , which is the <unk> principle is to do this whole life , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it comes to quiet . just a little number over time .
with space and the way in the room in other ways .
and then <unk> levels .
in this year -- you please show the slides -- in this year we &apos;re carrying the <unk> around us , a project we &apos;ve helped the design .
we can put this on a <unk> , which allows you to put more information about the clothing , while you &apos;re doing this <unk> .
( the scott adams : i noticed that i &apos;m going to be the foremost expert on the <unk> .
and we &apos;re also known to a new product today . it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown in public .
right now , the farmers just in the rainy season , not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the <unk> .
electrons go into a kind of <unk> and then only energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
it &apos;s what he thought he was there .
potatoes , some <unk> chromosomes . have you know that ?
all right . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and someone said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the point of the , henry &apos;s mind ?
we &apos;ve been doing about four years of this .
if google is a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 1940s , everybody was excited .
but imagine you , it &apos;s not really interested in .
but also a lot of the right , apparently , apparently , apparently benefited from propaganda .
when you look at the <unk> , it means &quot; <unk> &quot; with a a. &quot;
if i run this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , you would literally stop listening to it .
a lot of people get into cooking , but these are also big , public spaces like this , multiple <unk> , in million tiny little personal .
you can also do it in a nice place , like to a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you very much for you guys . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t at us at the front of the <unk> and couldn &apos;t see the economic growth between me and my <unk> , a exchange , a exchange , which we came from , but strangers .
now , i &apos;m saying , in the last year , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because the arab spring still still still spreading the , the <unk> is collapsed ...
this photograph was actually taken in a police station , and on the ground , they see the <unk> of the people who were being tracked by the police .
the kids just do their photographs in a class , the teachers gets them , they <unk> them on the <unk> .
so in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere there is a <unk> .
this is something that we can work in our lifetimes , i believed i could <unk> a difference , and i was trying to get out of the <unk> to come into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other characteristics that really really interesting .
what &apos;s what makes us more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human .
in humans , we developed the <unk> part of the <unk> , the name of the neocortex , the nature has applied this little trick .
it &apos;s not so that you look at there and say , &quot; what am i look at ?
it doesn &apos;t like a <unk> . don &apos;t even like a <unk> .
these are the things that are coming first .
we need a little police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on their knee . &quot;
she was traveling because they had to be elections in the time of elections .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she went the door , she said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no .
they wash this way .
this group used three , everybody one .
it &apos;s real .
it made english to learn and learn to the second language .
the computer already , and it &apos;s a by three participants in one of three participants .
if you know , you think differently than the u.s. states , who were actually part of our <unk> , because exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we would have a a a a a time between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data and the actual start with the data .
the price of this is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and rubbed themselves and they were their arms to go to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask for personal coach , how <unk> <unk> <unk> breath for bad breath .
i &apos;m not really comfortable with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peer into other people &apos;s heads and figuring out what they &apos;re offering .
they own <unk> humility .
this is what the unconscious is for .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many of men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey ?
and it &apos;s not normal , in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries in .
well , first , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- you see , if someone thinks about a place , and then it doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s like , &quot; this card sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that these words are tools that we use to express our thoughts , how do you know that grilled are better than hammer ?
and the <unk> has 33 different <unk> definitions for &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in the u.k.
i &apos;ve got the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary is &quot; the dictionary . &quot;
so , i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;m going to have landed .
and so , in this , a piece of play , while this three days , you start to understand , and i &apos;m listening to this , you know , why am i listening to all this goddamn stuff ?
you may be a ted speaker and so we can hold the conversation during the year , and next year after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturer don &apos;t have the <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a very precise amount of <unk> that would actually fold up on the palm of palm .
there was unsure whether it was already <unk> , and it was technically not able to find the broadcasters .
instead of <unk> , you &apos;re making you easily .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; we &apos;re going to live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> people .
we debate about the thesis of what the world needs now is nuclear , right ?
and so far , there are only three <unk> of this -- coal and gas , hydro , which is almost all around the world is -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve got the russian warheads we &apos;ve gotten into electricity .
<unk> emissions is equivalent emissions from all greenhouse gases and particles that are generating warming and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the amount of nuclear weapons with nuclear weapons with nuclear power , because we know that india and pakistan secretly have nuclear weapons through <unk> in <unk> systems .
for wind , the surface is much larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
reality is that 21 states have nuclear , right ?
and in the senate in the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get out of renewable sources of renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10 years of the time .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was taken by apollo .
for the first time we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the source of technology that allow us to allow us to the exploration of space .
26 groups from seven countries in the competition , there was a <unk> between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage of the sponsors is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you be surprised to us , i was fascinated ?
it means that can make areas even can get into space , and they can be incredibly small .
one challenge was to express this new algorithmic that can express this new algorithmic .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time because we had only seen the outside , the areas of the areas were <unk> , and it was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , amazing forms of areas . no human could make them by hand , but you can build them , and you could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- lots of shapes here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> , even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think that many people here in the room , many of you are in the same position .
so i think that women are becoming leaders in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , very important to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that for recently , for recently , people use more people like youtube and social networks to give their stories , and to show their own stories and their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we invite them to come and explore our part of the world .
so i was going to be more or less than &quot; anything .
so i thought , &quot; well , if i make these ants a pair of apartments , they &apos;re going to be there . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i got back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly , maybe five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i turn it down , and shaped by the <unk> .
so i crushed the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things come into little <unk> .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they did the task , you can do more extra .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of this , this absolute <unk> of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love the primary attributes of the divine .
my body &apos;s body flew into the one direction , my <unk> cycle .
i imagined all the <unk> i &apos;d probably not going to do with them , the <unk> that i may not been <unk> , the friends that i would not look frowning , the <unk> that i can &apos;t go with them .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in the back of you , against the wind , you just can get over and it makes you <unk> in the muck . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had taken off my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 <unk> chance of survival .
how i was more and more anonymous -- and at that time in my life , i was probably 14 pounds more than i am now .
and no one <unk> this modern <unk> in my eyes as a david black .
walking upright , you &apos;re going to say , is the cusp of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president america &apos;s the international commission for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born and a half and a half and a half was born was a and really got a fantastic <unk> of him .
so , as soon as i was trying to get to the piano , i became <unk> .
and at the end , you &apos;ve been so quickly , things like the &quot; flight of flight &quot; wasn &apos;t problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> that .
they &apos;re fighting to be the way of their own life in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that doesn &apos;t be fluid yet in a world that haven &apos;t been polluted yet .
we know that today , today , that they &apos;re capable that research was really impossible to be when i started .
the long attractive to the mother , the mother and the mother , who came into this long childhood , and the siblings , can stay and maintain the whole life , and that can be 60 to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge seas of the <unk> in the woods , so the pygmies pygmies , the pygmies , the pygmies , and the pygmies in the <unk> hunt and lived in their wonderful way of many hundreds of years , eaten in their wonderful way .
yesterday , someone said that .
so we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are others than the in new york .
and come to get me down here and <unk> me down here ?
there &apos;s the outside of politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of these different kinds of molecules -- so a <unk> reduction in the complexity , but still trying to create something more .
it &apos;s even very <unk> . if you &apos;re doing it , you actually don &apos;t really do something .
now , where they are all the experts for protocells are we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
so we then see again the self-assembly of this bodies of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs of these black mud -- these <unk> , very intricate , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin <unk> martin <unk> , experimental <unk> of chemicals that are living as living , and his work shows how life could be done first ... and maybe somewhere else .
this is a <unk> <unk> , to take your tadpole on the evening .
what &apos;s this -- where did they did that ? they &apos;ve taken it .
but if we did that at each -- every fire fire , we could redefine the case .
soot is the muck that &apos;s still in their pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated with -- -- with them .
the birds could jump from one to the rest of one .
you can talk about the news of him . you can talk to him .
but these flock , it becomes a great toll of our planet .
next is we &apos;re <unk> the skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working on for thousands of years , started with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that when we do all the world , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people to own a car .
let me talk to it just about hydrogen .
this is a huge energy energy to generate energy to generate energy .
if we can see these <unk> future , it can also be others .
you had to survive .
and we certainly put our unified school district to be , to get funding and support .
because why should our students go from their lives ?
it was a book , then to a picture .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see , how we started to build the <unk> , which is soon a big <unk> brazil .
so , as i came to my time , my <unk> , i studied this new <unk> field .
when you zoom in the south <unk> , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white areas on this map are protected in protected places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> , insects and <unk> places .
and maybe there &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s a lot of power to come up with science and visualizing another , to begin with these images . it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have a really dramatic level in our society , right now .
so i don &apos;t have to get into that .
you get the pristine thing to stay .
this is a <unk> building .
one example we all know is that the cell phone , right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are pieces of these things that help us to do it .
seriously -- clap -- this is really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future sees a sustainable future
you could think that this was a big problem for a law , but congress seem to not too much to be too much .
but if you put a lot of high-quality copies and it sells , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we &apos;ve made of things that causes us and every single option of the <unk> in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very elitist , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that made me almost broken me .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and persuasion .
when i said that , they said , &quot; let &apos;s show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to measure your country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what if you &apos;re arrested if you &apos;re being arrested .
come to tension in there , you get the presence of the schools , it &apos;s between teachers and parents , so the <unk> the teachers and the parents and the parents and the parents and say , &quot; give you hands .
you use sign strangers .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> , is one of the largest , dynamically <unk> computers in the world for this kind of <unk> .
you see the <unk> of the <unk> , which is what we &apos;ve created as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , it &apos;s data data from these two groups of people , how happy they are .
&quot; i think it &apos;s physical , financially , emotionally , mentally , and in almost any other way , &quot; i don &apos;t know a minute .
he was <unk> him for money , and of course , ray <unk> six months later the same idea .
in this case , because they &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;ve been told you about , <unk> images from <unk> images .
we made our materials , went out of the room , waiting half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
you know , you know , you know , two beautiful <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of for them major things and we said , &quot; what would you be ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> , and say , &quot; you know , we give it a <unk> , and we can make it two different ways .
<unk> , the big car and the <unk> fly is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t get on ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition doesn &apos;t come from the <unk> of <unk> , but it goes back to a time before we <unk> stories on <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of the <unk> roof , you know .
and so we let my father his father his <unk> , because i knew he would kill me when i was driving it alone , so we &apos;ll get the car .
&quot; and this guy had this guy to a blue uniform and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to be there ? because if i didn &apos;t cover <unk> , to <unk> me -- enough metaphors for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
you see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret <unk> .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look at ! &quot;
&quot; i vote for the little old lady , i &apos;ll damn it !
it &apos;s gone from the car . &quot;
i really am very afraid .
so what &apos;s the social result of this ?
where can i go and to who together ?
and when we have it , we &apos;re going to decide how many kilometers we &apos;re going to go into what <unk> where we live and work .
so smart bottleneck to the station , and you see exactly where their bus is driving and when he comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want us to get the wireless to the <unk> , and i &apos;m asking that this network of open standards for everyone to be available to everyone .
and they came up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came to a psychiatric condition in touch , knowing what a challenge can be .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to leave you with them , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> bear .
because they all were three years old .
and what i love about this story is that rosey grier is simply a authentic person , and therefore , it &apos;s about authenticity .
i was eating <unk> with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sleep .
j so many , it &apos;s so many , that it &apos;s become the same .
i thought it was strange to speculate , as it was a competition to wound across a fresh trip .
it &apos;s largely a white , rich <unk> , who didn &apos;t get the city for the city .
it looks pretty easy , but it was a <unk> .
people are <unk> about two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the <unk> of the new yorker that i found very emotional .
because , looking at four platforms along the <unk> -- where a result is a <unk> version of a <unk> -- -- we knew that it had to be be , to be be incorporated to be <unk> , and the changed definition of ground zero to react .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children would suffer every year concussions .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here and a concussion , most of us in a <unk> for a few hours to a few weeks .
you have to be familiar with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
and as it turns out , tom saw that a helmet for 20 dollars a good opportunity to keep a 100,000 <unk> .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair in the 1940s , as his doodles , of course , &quot; well , &quot; have been described and he described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that occurs in the genomic sequence .
it was said that there was no cure .
today , all countries have committed to provide patents for at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the company companies , their patents to <unk> and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> . the people were sitting in the <unk> sun , the afternoon at very high humidity and they didn &apos;t feel like .
they can adapt to their well-being .
he offers all these services , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so little things that you &apos;re doing right now , but for people who are working with the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you do this teacher from this teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does .
and the husband &apos;s husband , he was also sick by the <unk> of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies .
now , when we feel emotions , we &apos;re showing them .
and you could get the sense that the unhappy people are going to take a different structural position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet one of the two <unk> in itself , who are in a special way , on the left , and they get <unk> , that is soft and dark .
to make it a little bit , let me pull out for a moment .
older , eventually , is not just to get .
under the same circumstances , older people are the cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more of positive information than negative information than negative information .
we &apos;re the life .
and they would let me say , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to perform this <unk> for this girl on this bar .
kid david : it &apos;s so i &apos;m speaking , frankly , often , what happens when i dance .
they have me brother and uncles , and i was invited over a period of five years from the time .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie clearly clearly the sioux of the great sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota over the holy black hills .
the treaty of fort demanded that at least three quarter of the <unk> sign to sign to be <unk> to the country .
they were tired .
the <unk> is eight times the way on average average .
so what &apos;s going to us ?
and today ? child mortality sank since 1960 , 24 percent of the year .
you get it to be a pill or a syringe . you have to take every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we &apos;re like here , as you know , with people .
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called , are you smarter than a <unk> ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is , this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i would use it every day . &quot;
we have to connect this with a scientific technique .
this is something else to do a <unk> campaign campaign .
what &apos;s nothing new .
the lamps will be dark .
we make them for our clients .
we have the one in the sun .
now , logic -- logic , logically , you &apos;re looking at this position to move from this position -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . if every time , another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m presenting some <unk> .
here , i have to look at my <unk> , so i can follow my maps as a <unk> , oh , we &apos;d have to start with -- not a problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what &apos;s what i &apos;m going to use ? the queen or five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait at moment -- take a card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the cards -- here -- all the cards -- right ?
and finally , the king -- in this ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was going to my whole company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a musical , you could not turn off the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i say my students , and , if you have a fallacy , you &apos;ll pick a flip , and then everybody sees . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the time from h after e , and you will hear everything that could say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , and i had a <unk> and had a insight and suddenly a insight .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost lost .
so ladies and gentlemen of the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks in the 21st century , however , this <unk> , <unk> doesn &apos;t work , often , and they don &apos;t have damage .
think about their own work .
standard standard is smaller .
these are the building blocks of a completely new <unk> of our businesses .
this one day intense autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> that might never have ever been given .
make it because you like to do it .
it &apos;s used by its easy weight .
in a series of 55 degrees , they dissolve in proportion , every sphere and its distances , to the little soil , to this little soil .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows the other direction .
that &apos;s developed with the years in many <unk> .
the <unk> of the object would probably be a <unk> picture of the earth .
but it leaves that 10 percent or more back , which is most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and at a club for <unk> dollars .
charitable organizations have to be withdrawn , courageous , massive powerful , to try and <unk> , that they fail , they will be pulled through the <unk> .
so what should they do ?
the overhead was now .
dan <unk> : our thinking about charity
then there was the <unk> audience , yes , that &apos;s so much of the music to music .
people who made these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the process of music as she &apos;s written , not to interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what &apos;s the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is available , when it &apos;s needed . it &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is the process .
as a <unk> , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and what we &apos;re going to do from here .
there are 98 percent nations over the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
you think about whether they should move it forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition to the transition , we would have to invent these entire community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really equilibrium . and to a degree of <unk> , the games that they play to hide this , the subject is so very , so you can &apos;t see what the are the very obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not going to be facing this big challenge .
and even if they &apos;re like , they could get some money to get there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was in my life , and i was trying to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
a lot of years after the solar-powered clocks said a young lady i knew that sex may be so good for the five senses .
the other thing that we have to do is good sex all five senses on an extreme level .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes the life interesting .
we are all born as artists .
if you have a conversation that , the next to come up to the next answer to <unk> what it started .
but their parents tell you , &quot; it &apos;s all going to soil all the waves . &quot;
but kids are usually doing art . it &apos;s a lot of fun .

the <unk> <unk> is taking the molas , if you come into the bay , you put them down into a kind of <unk> , and throws them around .

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a ingenious group of politically <unk> hackers is the 2011 .
the net connects everything , and will be able to convey a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses its <unk> information , but not for financial profit .
he explained to me how he was in 2003 and he was in the way in new york on tour , took 10,000 dollars from the atm machine , <unk> dollars from the atm machine using using <unk> credit cards .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and respect middle class , his <unk> , with a teenager , it took him to the <unk> .
and most of the , with exception of the script and <unk> , they don &apos;t have to be the social skills in the world world -- just in the net .
i think there &apos;s multiple reasons . i &apos;m not going to get into detail , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market . and what is driving the market is particularly -- number one is the big demographic <unk> .
we &apos;ve found lots of examples of the dead big boxes that have been transformed into all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many schools , and many libraries , like this .
and i finally expect the streets are going to be through the mall in the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped inspire that eight of the <unk> <unk> plans in <unk> plans to become <unk> .
it was covered by the parking lot .
their people are different than typical <unk> , but they &apos;re less than cities than cities .
&quot; his vagina &quot; to look at his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t really start there , with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the kind of thing that exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies of our heads -- that this separation has created a division that are often the public .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings because it &apos;s very good with happiness , and agnes .
it may be a lot of my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than this is happening today , and once of a future as independent country dreamed .
well , maybe he was too , <unk> , because he was staying , and he was going to get the nazis and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer , &quot; bring me the best workers who can find and if they &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll get them . &quot;
and also clearly , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all this beautiful .
&quot; uh-huh ! &quot; , dr. theatre , &quot; i &apos;m going to go into film . &quot;
like , he said too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we care about the tough cases , and we order to order to keep the other for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went with , during the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not , it &apos;s going to keep , keep it as long , until you keep doing it .
so what i want to try to do with this -- i hope to get the following .
and what i want to point out later in this presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. are under the ocean .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s because photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles . the <unk> is <unk> miles .
and so we drove along the <unk> of the <unk> in a field to the <unk> , and they found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new <unk> of <unk> , with a <unk> , which is me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we find the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i looked at it yesterday , it &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would have a child without license control of my tax system .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is only difficult to be available .
when we saw the impact of the <unk> , andrew and i , we had to zoom in to the many people how possible to provide the best possible education .
what was the special thing about these classes ?
the video will be interrupted all the few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple <unk> is not so bad thing .
and in terms of a few courses , you can ask questions that are the most common , and how to help the students to remediate .
we actually see the beginning of either by a personalized <unk> or by <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was to be what infinity means when i was a child .
and in our society , it &apos;s mostly about the reality of others .
i &apos;ve been talking to the value of the value of newton &apos;s value , like , for example , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a <unk> .
so , you can understand my surprise , when i was in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the visionary of the <unk> reserves , &quot; <unk> edges be his <unk> .
i think you can make things about these things that have , and not about the ones that don &apos;t have . right from this reason , i &apos;m not paying a jokes about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to get this old time of the <unk> , which i tell you .
he said , i &apos;d have to give him more respect because it &apos;s going to take 18 years to get a really good <unk> .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid , this active someone doesn &apos;t like us .
i once thought about moshe <unk> thought about beauty that she was told us yesterday , because his hyde in his book says that triggered the beauty can be able to make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense costs of the security costs , and what the defense of defense costs of our freedom , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , there was no astronomer on the world , well , or very few astronomers -- that there &apos;s planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly constantly about this experiment with a particle accelerator accelerator , and a neutron could , the world destroyed .
we have to be the same set of biotechnology like in <unk> .
so , we don &apos;t want to see , of course .
what can we do in the world ?
and now the worst thing is .
we spend a lot of money on it , to ensure that we don &apos;t die in a <unk> , but we &apos;re almost not going to be , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get on the wrong foot on the wrong foot .
i hope that it will .
it &apos;s very , very important because this is the system , the <unk> , which came to the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we know only since recent .
and this is what the system is , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who gets to come to the database , and i can get the information that &apos;s needed for everything that &apos;s happening for everything .
we &apos;re on the wave to ride , technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes that we &apos;ve never seen before .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that our oceans to the global , interactive lab -- and a <unk> <unk> about the world of depth .
so i think optimism is that optimism is going forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the obvious . you know too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , always be unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , instead of doing the same time , so that it &apos;s hollowed out of his insignificance .
the risks that they have never been as <unk> as they should be in a very similar city .
there are the emotions of victims .
daniel <unk> builds up very large ideas . he calls 17 terms of architecture that has been -- raw , daring , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for each of every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the car .
so , i &apos;m going to draw something like this , or will it just be a few <unk> <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just to get it . if you don &apos;t , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and with this capital , and then you get a traffic on the roof and then the <unk> or <unk> a monthly <unk> , which is smaller than the electricity source .
we almost failed , but we &apos;ve come across to 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet machine .
how about everything in earth could be so innovative ?
look at that .
boy , when you &apos;re using our livestock , and you see a cheetahs like he eats one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous . it just just go to him .
we were suffering .
our tradition looks like this : in any <unk> , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so far , we were with the world of the world in the world , the very small programs to get up on the <unk> of programs to <unk> .
also very important -- we invest in the money in the enlightenment , hiv and hiv .
<unk> -- always again a <unk> of many in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding that price behind the cost of enormous winning .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> <unk> the <unk> revolution for food .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
science sees the world in the mind , quantitatively , where they &apos;re measured and described , but they have the art to knowledge and insight .
so from the plan of a few weeks , after three weeks , a plan to 25 .
this is the natural cycle .
it wouldn &apos;t normally be a <unk> photographer , a photograph to <unk> , right ? but it &apos;s sometimes to be that to demonstrate the dimensions .
here you see , it &apos;s going back to the glaciers .
this is a cameras here .
could india , the origin of or a global center for innovation is just as being a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
so if we were talking to people in these <unk> , they were working on , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor professor , if they were not a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for treatments , as well as well , <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , <unk> , <unk> in the morning .
it &apos;s a bit like -- this is a recent <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see one .
each one in our society comes with cancer -- if not personally , through a loved , , a family member , a member member , a friend member , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material is the chromosomes , inside of a nucleus .
we applied fields in the lab with 20 different types of types of types , and we see this effect of all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in six months after the tumor , and it starts <unk> .
it &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , it &apos;s 15 feet , and they collect rainwater from the roof , it &apos;s a little pipe , and from your courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , it looks like this .
somewhere in a place , it &apos;s going to a <unk> through that scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and groundwater .
and they have to go down again .
these are the beautiful ones that we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> is 27 percent of the : 600,000 less people have hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
you get the jobs in the textiles , people get out of the <unk> and they bring them into industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , there &apos;s the <unk> , basically , every country with a <unk> <unk> , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> <unk> of say , three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and 70s , india grew &apos;t really .
buy african products .
but i think there &apos;s a lot bigger problem with it , that this logic -- that we should drop bombs and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and then , people were being picked up and four of them were selected to go and to <unk> , and they &apos;re to <unk> , to be careful about it .
now , citizens in the planning to be in 2020 , doesn &apos;t necessarily change anything , because there are still the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : full the internet <unk> <unk> ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was with some younger guys with us .
because for me , in this time , and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; do you want to be sex or drugs -- and drugs we don &apos;t .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indian , and also politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m quite about the <unk> , who &apos;s our country , but , all the <unk> talk about india as a new <unk> , , indeed the new superpower .
in other words , we tell us all sorts of stories about countries , whether they want to be the daylight or not .
but then the lightning bolt in our country was pretty slowly , it took about half an hour to a <unk> call .
you can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can be explicit consequences . ok .
and those of you who have your money , may be surprised to see how many <unk> are available to the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> code .
i went home and i was a little bit of a little bit , and i found some scary statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath of water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this phrase , this expression comes from a critic , a early critic and this is one part of the i just love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and this is a good thing , because if it would have been like , mother nature had a problem : how to get the world in the world , we get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i picked it for the end .
ok ? stop . it &apos;s going to take .
i don &apos;t know why there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually actually know that the most important thing you know , why we want to really <unk> the very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see something like this .
bob mckim has a different very -- a different version of this exercise done in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better way , a lot more creative results , when all the rules are .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all these uncertainty , as long as you leave back in the corridor , while the doctors are going to be a <unk> case , and you ask what &apos;s going on .
and so , by that , we would all feel secure , and we would have a good time because we agreed on the rules and so that .
we do everything that leads to success , but then we believe we &apos;ve done it , we &apos;re going to be happy and let &apos;s just stop and stop , and they just stop doing all this thing that we did .
i was faster , but just as depressed .
i learned that success is not one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for always , the last time in the public .
he made sure everything all fit together .
it took 900 people involved in part .
and the second thing is that people are obviously a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , the state of us not only to determine our self , but it also requires us to form ourselves , but it also requires us .
it means we &apos;re going to fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kind of questions that i wanted to do is , what are the intentions that are the app that are when you design something ?
so , i said , and my colleague sebastian <unk> us to have to be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you a fall .
he <unk> them in the right position , she &apos;s <unk> it with his nose and beating .
we learned the first surprise .
there was a kind of <unk> , to create the amount of power , and the speed that we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load cell measures , and this is actually a <unk> load cell with a crystal .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the fluid , and it &apos;s going to get up and hit the load cell .
one very , very <unk> solution to the special problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , it &apos;s the ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical <unk> that ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , not even <unk> that can just make this three-dimensional space .
now , you see it -- he just let me stand .
the submarine , it was the back year , this is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as a <unk> , <unk> , , please , for obvious example , is not the right idea we need to choose .
basically , new york on the backs of the <unk> , our streets via their shells .
in these eight <unk> of chambers , small <unk> , <unk> , which is practically <unk> .
so you moved around around london , and was overwhelmed with this <unk> .
after all , this created snow map of the eruption .
and this is happening every second week .
i made her portrait at the top of the <unk> .
and in this region of amazonas , in 1972 , in this region of the amazon .
the other side of the field is in the torah , where it &apos;s actually to stop bin laden . this is <unk> .
this was one of the great <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me move and show you the hubble <unk> dome .
but then you get to jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . this is a problem .
this is the part of being the beginning to understand this , the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so , the stuff that comes in the picture of this , dark matter .
and as you saw this picture for the first time , you can &apos;t see it a lot .
this is a simulation that has been a long , just to do this one month , just to make this visible .
with <unk> , we have a resolution that &apos;s about this image of the earth , which you can see the complicated pattern of earth .
and we &apos;re of course , of course , we &apos;re stressed .
forty-seven percent .
it &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re doing it all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i got into a cycle . that led to a lot of pain and problems with the joints , so i could almost hold anything more .
so i asked me , you could be creative , if you look at the constraints with the constraints ?
this is not the whole morning .
the <unk> is <unk> , as as a <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
stalin &apos;s <unk> famine in the &apos; 30s , killing millions of <unk> , and in the 1940s , they were the nazis to the nazis , the <unk> , burned , raping , and many of the women were coming back as a <unk> to germany .
and he &apos;s the grief to kill . &quot;
and as a result , as a result , the notion of the most of the , we &apos;ve learned what we &apos;ve learned about the virtual world , and about our identity , could use to live a better life in the real world .
we get used to a new way to be in common .
human relationships are exuberant , messy and <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
because in the moment , in the moment , even for a few seconds , they will get <unk> , so , fear , get out , you &apos;re going to reach for an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in jeopardy , because in truth , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently we didn &apos;t have the <unk> of the <unk> who some of our graduate students had predicted , and pretty often , i felt that they had a predictions of a <unk> .
maybe because my father has been reading about this .
so i let them go to quiet -- but it &apos;s neat and nurtured , they had to be .
and finally , i thought a pyramid , but i don &apos;t have to go into it .
although , although you lose , not afraid of failing failing when we &apos;ve given all the time , because who can give people more desire than anything he can do .
when i name it , i don &apos;t know an answer .
have i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials are used different types of stem cells for heart disease .
just last month , it &apos;s just last month , we managed to show up the creation of human <unk> .
we can map them , and then turn a degree centigrade , and so the kidney , you can just analyze this information and then you print it by print data .
i couldn &apos;t go to school , and i couldn &apos;t get dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do this surgery . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area called the <unk> .
and connected to these <unk> , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the <unk> wikipedia and everything between between the <unk> wikipedia and everything that they showed the power of a lot .
thirdly , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need , this is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music that &apos;s playing .
i &apos;m a name of joseph and a member member of a member of parliament in kenya .
we need to be our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together : did anybody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give up the masters in moscow , and work full-time work working on this .
it can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the <unk> of the <unk> work to the city of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so this is then , in the 18 minutes , the <unk> i &apos;ve been able to speak to the , between between the , and <unk> people who are going to be gone into cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green stuff in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have a political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i was part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these guys who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> , like i , helped me get their supportive of their own support , <unk> officials in law .
and then , at the time , normally , <unk> was just with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read every <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , in the different english-speaking countries , the u.k. , usa , canada , australia , australia , and new new , to have to have a different <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . life has been over since more than doubled , and it &apos;s growing steadily at a speed of five hours per day .
another one thing . i want to make people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new age age is a good news , because when the androids take the androids , we don &apos;t have to get to the more , and we don &apos;t have to do it , and we would have <unk> and <unk> .
the societal challenges of this inequality should be addressed .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially sharply , especially in short .
and my greatest concern is that we create a world with <unk> technologies , embedded in a slightly more sustainable society and supported by a economy that promote inequality .
and over the years , i started to feel increasingly <unk> with this notion of god .
some have a few of the <unk> , we only share with a god that divides our pain .
in the second part of the second , the line comes &quot; the line of the line of the line . &quot;
so who &apos;s god , if not the great <unk> or <unk> ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the way , i mean my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started exploring was the story of the technology technology .
we have no <unk> , we &apos;ve had no <unk> , that was older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer tribes are 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies has used to these new nutrition .
so this sameness of energy and matter , the einstein has shown and also the modern science of the <unk> shows that entropy and information and matter and energy and energy are all interconnected , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants its own plug in your own plug .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re going to be a new job .
a great development that started started to move around and continues , and our choice is in the technique is really , in fact , is really in the technique that is much more powerful than we .
and then they said , &quot; well , we have five classes to 40 students 30 to 40 students .
we ate it all down , and they found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had this -- while we &apos;ve got over , somebody said , &quot; you know what the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we &apos;ve been waiting , we were sitting on the tables , and i waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for the adults who were working on the <unk> , who didn &apos;t really know when they really knew it was only a toilet .
the teachers that we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
so about the <unk> have been working with you in the book , and this is this wonderful .
and right behind it -- there &apos;s normally a little chain -- right behind them , they saw children were taught .
there &apos;s also this <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see in <unk> , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s bringing his cousin with his own .
he &apos;s a email , he &apos;ll give you any question to you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . &quot;
there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is the end of the battle , and there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is conducive to create schools and jobs .
she sent their children to school -- i found a new home .
there &apos;s one that &apos;s manual to full idiots , did you know that ?
on the cape one , there is <unk> roads , and we all can drive .
this is my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a sense , i felt so badly .
so i was encountered this kind of complications .
i found that these cheetos are very good <unk> .
so , college is the hardest difficult , so number 10 .
of everything in a strange <unk> of <unk> , which is a window of all over time to the moment that the street had had black <unk> and these <unk> <unk> <unk> there in the sun .
and i was going through the great talk of karen armstrong thinks that religion really understood really understood , but to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen , and the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it has exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> an area that is about equal size of the state .
but it &apos;s not only the countries in the world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we own through the assumption of that challenge .
so before i show you a few images to cover , i want to point out of this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
this is the rca that is really an extraordinary school .
we have discussed with keith <unk> , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show a little bit beautiful in their talks , fear of being a stupid <unk> .
here &apos;s examples of this is that you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to think more about what robots are .
no . so i had to think a little bit .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask ourselves as physicists .
we can push it up . the forces are more , and there are more <unk> , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 , &quot; a whole tape
and there are some employees in foundations that call this <unk> .
the idea of justice , which is the to our lives , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s really in life , what &apos;s just in life , what are we should do social justice .
and as this is , he &apos;s <unk> during the <unk> .
so every week , every week , the <unk> will come round . &quot; god , you answered . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , a infection or an operation .
the muscle was frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> call &quot; <unk> .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- the way , frankly , that kind of pain is not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the back of the line of all , and these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which is a part of the core of a comet <unk> .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a <unk> and choose and choose , and therefore we can change our future .
and at that time , i led to the , the only independent , to be accurate , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that <unk> survival and a great company would be gone , if it was just gone , what was really the right .
and the end of the meeting says , look , it won &apos;t work , you will never see your money , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re going to get us your business plan with what they actually did .
look , we &apos;ve started in east and <unk> and the work with our work , and they went to russia .
after a while we opened a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve created the idea of being at the bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you organize the funding , so that there is no <unk> , no blind running around to find themselves .
so , why does this work like this ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some of the one of the things call this theory of everything .
just example , this : newton found the law of gravity , the works like one divided through the square of the <unk> between the other <unk> objects .
the more symmetry you have , the better is you think of simplicity and elegance theory . theory .
one thing about that , i thought , most of us today , but at his time , it wasn &apos;t of granted .
it doesn &apos;t change the meaning of this world that they follow the laws of law and accidents .
but he was reading every free moment he had , books .
and so , by that ambition , he came back to the back .
but when he was just in the process of his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and karate , because he was <unk> for the morning of a thousand hands .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the <unk> house .
but i have to say , the more i i understand , the more i understand what was incredible privilege to have this aging lion for a man as many hours .
and as lincoln was telling the story , all after the u.k. after the u.k.
i asked my father to tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that i &apos;m going to spend a life in my way to live in the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is evidence that the jews in exile , after the years , they sat in babylon and with the memory of jerusalem to be the streets and the memory of jerusalem that these had been going to go home .
all these are being respected .
the <unk> cylinder is from the priests of the great <unk> of <unk> , marduk , wrote .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people in iran living jewish to tehran .
some knowledge of more about the living conditions , but they think they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
the newly babies are <unk> in the first few hours , but their needs were not <unk> and at some point , they were not <unk> , and in less days , they were <unk> , <unk> and start in the air , like everyone else .
one study shows that <unk> 10 percent of a <unk> cost , whereas <unk> is about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i was just spent my whole life on a camera .
you know quite quickly what you &apos;re doing to find an answer .
it was <unk> people -- most of them friends and family .
we heard each one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it &apos;s been able to get unicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and on its options , etc . , etc . -- and they were really going to be really .
we connect with <unk> -- i &apos;ve met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; at london 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , to their business .
the largest brains brains are also cognitively cognitively .
i &apos;m never going to get the literature after the origin of this number , but i never couldn &apos;t .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors may have invented a million years ago when they discovered that cooking .
quite simple ways for the most conversations that i did .
and i think i &apos;m just standing at the beginning .
but once the fight itself , the physical rehabilitation was subjected to the physical rehabilitation .
and he was a child who was a child , his son , in the face of the workplace , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking to my bosses in the headquarters , and i said you -- i &apos;m -- i said , &quot; look , we start with a couple of hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of the <unk> started fighting .
so i said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
but , yes , we have to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital could have been able to do that hospital .
why ? because the way i was was being banned .
but i learned something more <unk> than that , which is that the leader -- the manager of the economy -- tremendous <unk> decisions that had had to the very short of the <unk> .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children and their children &apos;s important .
i &apos;m trying to have the experience i had at swarthmore , to africa .
is my time , my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment , which is a great society within a generation .
you will note that he &apos;s the <unk> ball ball very much -- the sun that we draw as a child .
in fact , this is something that is something that is about half of them , more than half , not being familiar .
32 pills &apos;s <unk> .
i guess . &quot;
and those are the messages they &apos;re communicating them ?
because , in the bottom line , the sponsors love it , and he &apos;s all constantly pushing on television .
a professional <unk> who talks about dead , they don &apos;t get me ?
what &apos;s <unk> ?
we would like to get people to people like to <unk> , <unk> and community authorities , so they do something .
thank you .
and so the entire area is often a generator .
there &apos;s got something better . &quot;
but this is how the user can control whether it &apos;s just electricity or not because they can drive the <unk> on the basis , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most powerful and appropriate device that we can provide hospitals .
the different types of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like the typeface <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society of the <unk> .
anyway , until 1998 , as a <unk> , john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in 1800 , centuries ago .
almost one-fifth of all greenhouse gas comes from livestock are <unk> -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the <unk> to <unk> and animals on the animals that are producing the animals like the animal animals , it &apos;s not just okay .
<unk> was a very bad thing .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would think that maybe that might not be so bad at all .
about a year ago , i asked a question : &quot; why am i , i know what i know , not a vegetarian ? &quot;
and the weekend you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and all the names , even though it &apos;s even even mistakes .
you get distracted . he finally win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it was more of interest , to find more about when the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a <unk> of art .
human nature has to change .
but one part of the reason -- and this is why we have a ethical level in the pursuit of -- is that they are inherently valuable .
it may be more complicated to people , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to do .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of fluid .
and so i think that &apos;s what they can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our very first of pizza , and <unk> the individual <unk> , while the messenger in the corridor , and we <unk> us .
i was sure 20 , before i was first in art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;re going to choose a criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshopped .
they were interested in a novel , alternative <unk> , and they needed money , so they decided they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and he did this , it was hilarious -- the <unk> that we got .
and it describes how the <unk> -- everything you say is , because of the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s got origami . so there .
people reinventing mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles .
or they &apos;re pushing it on the top and they &apos;re going 50 stars to a flag with 13 .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules that you put circles , you put them into the <unk> lines , the extra rules . this makes the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going into space or whether you &apos;re going into your body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington to a much more free time .
we only have three minutes , but we &apos;re talking about hours hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this is very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> the labor market , and it goes to the more .
you had instruction from the top .
because i write about all the book , i still still <unk> , and i have no answer .
and that was very discouraging for her .
since we haven &apos;t completely processed this information , they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and some overblown way , where you can see , stereotypical .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who &apos;s in the middle and the way to hear the cable .
and the personal income on a scale that has been given to be coming down in this time , has almost tripled .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you know , about 60 bits per second .
and so it &apos;s going to be done in the last book of my &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed a few ceos who are very successful and very much more ethical , with great social sense .
now , in control is always a safe thing , because you feel , but not quite a lot of them .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because my grandparents was born , they had their own meaning , which is home , and even in <unk> , which was at the , and even in <unk> , which was born on <unk> , and they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or present and present and the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where are you home ?
there was a big gap between the one billion in the developed countries , and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by looking at the digital technology , digital technology .
the child survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we , &quot; your brits and your mortality mortality in heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started working with <unk> , and i was growing , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be equally good at the equator .
certainly many of progress , many more <unk> lives .
this is actually a real photography , at the time , showing that the limb in less <unk> .
and here you see the right , which is six months later , that technically <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> is comprised of two different types of types .
so we put it back into this oven-like device .
even more and more complex organs , and with the vast complex solid organs are the high <unk> , with every lot of <unk> organs like heart , liver and uncles .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that will not be judged by and no tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there , someone would have a idea .
so , i &apos;m a little bit of panic -- different than all of the time and sugar , that i had -- but this is an entrepreneur really creepy .
it doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a <unk> .
i went to door to door and sell it to the door and sell it .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
it &apos;s pointless . &quot; you have to find a way to get to get on money .
i sold a huge amount of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks and learn , the ability of the <unk> , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and you &apos;re going to be bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad <unk> looks like .
these young , <unk> .
the development of today &apos;s students , all the interests except for a overboard .
the <unk> of <unk> or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , most of our students .
the values of the past is also <unk> . that &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy policy principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what we should be concerned about , when we think about conservatives -- except that case the dawn session -- what &apos;s this : you &apos;re going to church .
yeah , i know , you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just leads to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with .
totally different .
in fact , it &apos;s not a right , but i &apos;m sure -- let me go through this -- creative commons offers a simple way to make the liberties of their content with the liberties that you want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder , how many times it happens .
he told me that he &apos;s <unk> the <unk> , and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , i had the idea of today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to finish it through this process and show you what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general , general , too happy .
i was just surviving , just to understand .
i &apos;m going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way , as microbes can spread through people , architects , <unk> spaces like to interact with the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in such a labs and offices .
imagine a design , you know , take the microbes , for example , or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to be the <unk> , and a way to do that , was to get to the , one of these humpback whales were <unk> .
on 78 percent of the voices . to give you an idea of the <unk> victory : the <unk> two in the <unk> , only three percent .
and the last message i want to share with you is , you can be online very successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what &apos;s a great privilege of being today today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando , are <unk> .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to be ahead of the <unk> to make today that possible , which is going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really going to be really . science tomorrow .
there &apos;s color red and the color black , you &apos;re running the continuously changing from day to night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not as a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a civilization-state , based on a civilization , a system .
and the reason for this , first , the state gets a very special -- -- to be a very special thing than the representative , the embodiment and the <unk> of chinese civilization , the <unk> .
it was in 72 miles long , <unk> beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of the <unk> rapidly <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he goes down a street on the suburb , and the cars are driving underneath .
red , the red is falling blue is green = green , <unk> is purple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second one was in chinese .
she was true to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the mother of my friends .
they all accepted their picture next to the other one .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re looking at a <unk> face -- that &apos;s a funny <unk> , right here ? &quot;
most places i went to , i decided to go to the media because i heard about it .
i took more photos , and we launched this project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were met , a woman , &quot; now i can see god . &quot;
because this is a huge part of it . there &apos;s layers behind every photo .
but they basically took a promise taken to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the interconnectedness and what they &apos;re going to be , as it &apos;s going to be , i think there are some of the factors i want to give you as a <unk> .
they have a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it &apos;s demanding participating in participation . cities have been welcome to participate in the .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years old , extraordinary time .
and miniaturization .
it would be a significant <unk> .
it &apos;s vital that at ted ideas , ideas that we &apos;re thinking about , and make sure that this is a particularly successful century , and not one of <unk> and <unk> .
my family &apos;s family are boring academics who are concerned about <unk> from <unk> to our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something really stuck .
i was sitting , as you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
and then netra has been my career , i &apos;ve got a lot of success .
i began to explore the <unk> <unk> of the human mind .
this time , i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here in ted 2006 : actually , in 2006 , is very excited .
it would be very dangerous , if you fall away .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents , this is important for their inner .
when i have a talent , it &apos;s things like to take away from the time i &apos;ve got <unk> .
the body has a higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body is <unk> by itself .
and this is going to be very far .
i asked him what that means .
at that point , you can , if you want to learn multiple languages , and they take them without any other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s already better .
i think they &apos;re right to me that they look very well .
and have done done with 50,000 students over 50,000 students , so about half a dozen schools , my reader , by the way .
we found out -- and we were going to be pretty much wrong with it , and we then realized , the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little primer on the <unk>
and ultimately , the only person , the first person , is a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry &apos;s cavalry , and with <unk> , and with <unk> .
goliath is light prey . he &apos;s got no chance .
so goliath is a bigger than a <unk> of time , and usually there &apos;s a explanation for this , if there &apos;s a kind of the norm .
and i think there &apos;s a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out that we are covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are even good at us , rather than killing us .
they have all the microbes and the donor then put the donor into the receiver .
most of the pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , one or two , maybe five different species , and the human community has thousands of thousands of species .
we need a <unk> of the microbes that are in and in people &apos;s lives so we can understand what they do to our lives .
so many people think about the internet is very tied up , but it &apos;s true globally . we have in many , many languages .
and when you had a ridiculous lifestyle on the page of me , they thought they would just just nonsense in nonsense .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we have 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule for the beginning .
and i &apos;d like to say , and i like , the only person who actually knows the rules of wikipedia , so ...
it seems to me , as being most textbook that are used to be used to be used to be the training of our children , from nature .
in the jungle in guatemala , <unk> , says , says , says , says , says , says , says , says , &quot;
a <unk> indian <unk> in <unk> is told a tuesday in the year , and here it is .

it went upward and keep on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws of my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the liberal god -- and both work together .

we started to organize makers for our maker .
<unk> , or billy bass , or something like that .

there &apos;s glamour physics .
and in fact , we see these <unk> photos of stars all the time -- you call them <unk> .
they &apos;re not looking about a way , but you have to think of their world .

but it &apos;s always the illusion that you &apos;re buying this lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> <unk> -- symbolizes through the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .

and everybody thought , i &apos;d be good , but on the new kind of sand , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s going to be with <unk> ? &quot;
and i was going to look at my surgery , i was looking at them , and i was like , &quot; how am i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , after the next , , after the boys here are the community .

the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts , that the universe is not moving into complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here is the blue areas are about a thousandth of bone than the red areas .
it works over smaller distances as gravity , what explains why they and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;ll be familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about the insurance .
and then they have to decide how they invest in their 52 choices , and they &apos;ve never heard of a <unk> .

thank you .
and this knowledge has too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her to walter raleigh to separate her human in the , to separate her human part of their divine .
do you get a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> you out ! <unk> you out ! you get out !

he said , &quot; you can &apos;t <unk> a person who says it &apos;s too sleeping . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if if you can all be able to be able to be able to be able to achieve this way to a limited planet ?
coke must work with diet .
these are nine of them .
and at the end , we , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production on the table and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t buy the juice ; they also buy carbon in the trees , to cover the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the product to europe .
this is how communication is flowing between brain and spinal cord , this leads to a complete and sustained paralysis .
after some years , we managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> , the the nervous system of the spinal cord <unk> to a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working 10 years hard to do this goal .
after a few weeks , we &apos;re going to make a programmable pump to inject a individual <unk> directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a child who was working .
he was talking about the world , like she &quot; and the world , as it should be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women are many obstacles from the way .
the white house , and the desk he &apos;s sitting on , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the last day , the woman came to the , and we talked about it , and we talked about a very short , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneous , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have it all .
so the internet takes <unk> and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world , the most powerful company in the world is run , and there was nothing that youtube or google would have to do it .
and today wikipedia is so <unk> that you can find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and this has wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s <unk> <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t cover the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem in some countries are very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was a lot of effort to give students with <unk> or social families have equal opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic <unk> , the teachers are going to be alone and have a lot of <unk> .
some people argue that the change the <unk> looks like a <unk> .
but if you look at the question of this perspective , you see what &apos;s going to happen in the last 60 years .
and i was going to go through 15 kilometers to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could also do that with phones .
so they get a store for you .
&quot; the government must provide economic services services . &quot;
it was once , a long ago , a long time ago when i was 24 , i was at the ninth of st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my map if i &apos;m here there .
i &apos;m going to bring a invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going to be a time of the war , with low life expectancy .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but also the economy to grow .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will we really accept the rich countries that are really accept the world of the world , and the power transition from there , where they have been 50 to 100 years years back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of the mass doesn &apos;t .
and then you give you the fact that we &apos;re in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on the <unk> .
they move away from each other because the space is getting bigger .
by looking at things like clusters -- their <unk> , how many of you are as a function of time -- we can get in experience that are dark matter and dark energy in competing to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy man banjo boys : <unk> central -- new jersey ?
so , recycling and reusing are recycling , <unk> .
marc <unk> : a million reasons to invent the <unk> .
and indeed , these are these <unk> in gay men in the u.s. during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa and also a lot of children .
in uganda , we &apos;re seeing the distribution of the distribution .
it &apos;s pretty similar to close with a very similar loop .
but openness and connection has a prize if we think about pathology , that should be no surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> , the aids is reviewed from a economic perspective , and comes to a surprising conclusion , all of the our knowledge about the distribution of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i fascinated me because i watched this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; because he was the front of <unk> , but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a <unk> <unk> , and he was a <unk> of <unk> .
this is the hump that goes on water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves , why is the membrane and the way that it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> , my favorite , , we work with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry &apos;s used to use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and thankfully , no boys .
you can &apos;t do it against it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india because that was once again and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s praying . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over a thousand inmates of this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we &apos;re doing some years later , a kind of a captcha .
it &apos;s basically , you do it by you with a old book .
the number of the pages of these are actually used to be so high that the number of words that we &apos;re going to digitize a day , very big .
some of them are more .
we &apos;re divided the web into multiple languages .
then my favorite question is the question .
there &apos;s a way , two flies with a beat .
but what may even more surprising is the translation that we get from the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just a <unk> that we &apos;re going to be just exactly the same way that professional <unk> <unk> , and this is very surprising .
because people while they learn value , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they pay for their time .

i was playing the as a as the african african , the african terrorists .
well , from the first <unk> , a clear revelation , so no one had the absolute majority -- so the election had been continuing to a second round three weeks later .
so here &apos;s an interesting comparison here .
so i went to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century , not really much as much as we think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we can breathe that from a particular reason , and so that &apos;s like this .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to give you money to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but don &apos;t talk about religion there .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody was going to make a little bit of mind .
just to see what would happen when you merge the two together .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to get rich today , entrepreneurs will .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go on -- they don &apos;t get very carefully in the same time , and we &apos;re not measuring it from 20 years very carefully from satellites and they don &apos;t go .
biochemist kary mullis talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century and <unk> the curiosity , inspiring and care of caring and good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a very simple way of a living body , which these <unk> , decrepit spaces .

i love it , to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and the whole time i &apos;ve been talking about , i don &apos;t have a single rat in any of these places until recently when i was in the london .
the first question is , and maybe they write them on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual leaf , or on a virtual leaf , and you can see it , for audiences , you can see it .
and we then stop with , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> college in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except , except -- well , in your <unk> , you have thought , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s going on the night during the night ? &quot;
and one of the hardest problems is , if people have a idea of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert in inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , the different between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , it rains , <unk> , in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself introduced in a letter to a colleague of my colleague , the presumption that life was probably done somewhere in a warm little pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what is this fabric of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of thousands of them , in the same size of dna and protein , but it &apos;s not a carbon in perspective .
we want to transplant them into the environment , and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology , and you can get matter , then , then , it &apos;s actually what happens in fact .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this <unk> , each one is to measure .
and these are the professional female interviewer who sit down for an hour to a woman and ask them to her <unk> .
i was sitting on friday with friday , and i could see the mortality rate of this morning from <unk> was on this morning .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want to get more and more of them .
as you can see , this doesn &apos;t make sense a average to compute , a focus , and that &apos;s not a very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it as much .
and they were high , or very high , child , and the family were very large , six to eight .
there &apos;s also a <unk> .
whatever is it &apos;s worth for money .
yes , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he said , &quot; well , &quot; it &apos;s the <unk> question .
and the whole time was in advance .
and <unk> , after my mind , the world will make a difference , not just a few , but for everyone .
so , above the knee , yes , that would be difficult ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody &apos;s needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was on the council of scientific research research -- 40 laboratories -- when two <unk> didn &apos;t speak together , i built teams to do .
they &apos;re on this , and now i have apps on the app app .
it &apos;s about to lead to perfection and something an old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no longer <unk> .
because this reactor is not under a high pressure , chemically don &apos;t mean reactive , means that the <unk> doesn &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i &apos;ve designed here , a disruptive source of energy , the great scientific projects that is going to get electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move to a <unk> , in the experience of the experience that is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the <unk> provides for the case they run in the woods .
at the end of a long , good piece of <unk> he gives his son <unk> , he says this : &quot; especially , <unk> against yourself .

then it &apos;s just about to start at a point and to build it up to the end .
so i built it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love for love .
so 25 days : the <unk> is evolving 32 days : arms and hands , 36 days : the primitive spine begins to train this weeks , the <unk> of the time that the fetus develops .
the complexity that we &apos;re in a single system is beyond any understanding of understanding , or any today of the world today .
because apparently there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
recently , a colleague of berkeley , a colleague of berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an e-mail with a very interesting spectrum , and i said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways of -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- on the matter and chemical elements are made and regenerate .
because can you imagine that everything is <unk> ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; so , we &apos;re going to be in . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and when we look at <unk> , and oxygen , i think we have the perfect table in the table .
i mean , i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &apos;s like &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly excited to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- that was actually a little bit like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are you to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t right . stop .
we do this , as if what we do , no implications for other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , we &apos;re using it to make systematic improvements , we also think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and to understand .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
steven divides his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people praying praying .
i love this <unk> implant , and these were the only <unk> that were available online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a <unk> , you have no data , it &apos;s not going to be scientific ways .
this is the curve over the <unk> .
but my brother doesn &apos;t , with him .
so , if we went from here to <unk> , we would go on something that we &apos;re going to do something , 300 meters , and it &apos;s two per mile wide .
to change the state , you need only two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can make it better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s called the so-called <unk> .
hence , these are the <unk> of complex systems .
and it also implications for systemic risk .
so we could put any <unk> in any <unk> .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that are <unk> our wired world from view of the view of the complexity of view of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and you .
and we &apos;ve been prepared 500 of these <unk> .
without human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this is a graph that doesn &apos;t even mean something that data is invented .
and my brain begins very quickly think that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to positive positive in the world .
because this question predicts that our external world can predict our <unk> world , but the truth is that i can predict 10 percent of the <unk> of a person when i can predict their entire world .
and this is made a scientifically <unk> and wrong with it .
we &apos;re moving people when you open your <unk> , a positive email from the <unk> or the <unk> of someone in their social environment .
difficult to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , closed .
they said , &quot; it lasts .
you take a giant disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital media <unk> in tokyo .
do you hear that ? like cows ? this is at 4 o &apos;clock in logan .
so there &apos;s all these things to do , but most of i love i love the world to learn the world .
and i associate that with passion .
their culture comes to schools don &apos;t come to , and i want to see how to illustrate this problem .
so that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want girls to schools , which there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers , the boys have gone up ?
we need to change the attitude towards young boys in elementary school .
and you have the idea that you believe that this would be okay .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re going to take this hypothesis .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that this is why &quot; <unk> evidence of the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and i &apos;m going to end up , and i &apos;m also excited to be able to work .
and this was really an important lesson for me that you can really affect no object .
we have a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s <unk> with my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s running on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> -- so i &apos;m going to put it to a <unk> , so that people react in the glass of a different way , when you go to it .
i &apos;m going to turn my my first age , and then in an old man .
<unk> had to have been allowed to <unk> .
radio : what do you think about it ?
fold it just the wings and drive them .
so , i ask you a different question .
and he made a royal <unk> , with <unk> , the instruction had him and night , but with the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t seem to <unk> it very well .
because they found that <unk> <unk> the human behavior .
however , we have to make a clear <unk> <unk> , where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s too much fair .
so if we have all these resources available , we just have to ask the question -- and thaler and <unk> did this -- how we use these smart .
they &apos;re going to take the new <unk> .
they give them little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , soul and hearts , i left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; no . &quot;
all around us , <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s a different replicator in this <unk> of culture .
you probably have bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes as a space for all there .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hey .
they &apos;re using to make the resource of the planet , to produce more and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we see this third threat through this , as we &apos;ve come up the second and first ?
in conjunction with <unk> , this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , with various <unk> , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us more than we do it right . &quot;
and because i was burned to 70 percent of my body , it took a little bit about an hour .
we also figured it would be good , would have been able to recover from the pain to recover .
and how bad would be the punishment if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t like the most enterprising people -- the more commandments <unk> -- less <unk> , and the less religious -- those who almost almost no commandments to remember -- more than <unk> .
so if you &apos;re not going to get on money for a few seconds , because you get a brand , it makes a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces are very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in advertising .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly it becomes amazon to the brand and competing with the <unk> , , how they want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seem to be a leap ?
the audience i &apos;m not going to be able to explain it , i i had to explain my house -- these are structures that can transport sperm from one of an individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by bone , by looking at bone .
and this was the every hydrostatic skeleton that we found up to the natural , in nature , had found the same <unk> .
all of whom i showed was surprised to this .
a fun song about global warming , of jill sobule .
well , then i have to do well .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> is totally made of this , and ben was a <unk> .
so , on the point is what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to leave the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has been estimated the u.s. <unk> of the united nations , the capacity to the country to over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not on the destination .
they have to be very inexpensive to available .
but wouldn &apos;t be done for this point of the <unk> ?
they demanded by governments and they have <unk> and in many cases they have them .
but let &apos;s take a goal of , our goal would be to bring the the basis of the pyramid .
because because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profit .
he liked it on her laps because he said it was painful to be in his own bed .
in the <unk> , as sir <unk> <unk> and the british society for <unk> thought that the sun seems to <unk> .
so , what &apos;s fusion ? here &apos;s something <unk> .
and this energy is it &apos;s <unk> fusion .
it &apos;s like a traditional <unk> of the way that we do with conventional <unk> .
we have to make it a power power power .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a huge impact .
they wanted to most democracy , but they were all countries the population that were at the last month , their opinion was a <unk> of a civil officials -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people to have significantly the future .
so the question is to be , &quot; what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s women ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the news .
no one can listen to you , they &apos;re just sending a text .
you could see the <unk> effects of laws or the <unk> speech on a <unk> , and see what &apos;s going on .
flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
the smallest <unk> of the mammoth forces of nature is respecting the storms .
we can afford to the individuals as individuals and we have heard .
we think somebody else , someone else , someone who are <unk> , someone with more means that this problem is going to solve .
we didn &apos;t flew it into the pacific .
it took a full prototype until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s one page of this incredible <unk> , which is possible , and this is what it means .
and think about our moral footprint .
and the director was quite <unk> , and i told me he was insane , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several of these events , until i figured out what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago , my <unk> plan was to create a <unk> of the <unk> .
and you look down , you &apos;re down , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to come up with my post , and my home , where i was to come to the <unk> , and i can actually make these incredible rides with this group of <unk> children from ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how many times i would have to die my self , before i understand that it hasn &apos;t existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , , <unk> , this insight is not my <unk> self-esteem , this feeling of otherness .
it was because i didn &apos;t know what was between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and to be happy to what &apos;s next .
and this is a cafe in the ocean in the u.k.
but instead of instead of what we &apos;re focused on the way we focused on the way .
we also discovered that as a <unk> structure and a <unk> way through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important thing , but that seeds -- in the leading botanical gardens , they don &apos;t have seed seeds .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the cathedral , so that when you visually visually , it was kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s just the first few types you see , and the rest is just for nostalgia .
the book is called &quot; blank slate &quot; &quot; the popular notion of the human mind is a blank slate and all its texture of its texture , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that you like the people good good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether this <unk> appropriately , but then the <unk> seemed to be the <unk> .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> in the universities who are in in the situations in the situations .
now , the other is the other red is <unk> is parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell you this .
i also calls <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but they &apos;re telling it .
there &apos;s no movie script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think about .
oh , i live in a computer program -- this is strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s like -- we &apos;ve explained the work to the war , as a society , everybody from us .
your iphone without the people who are the same set of circuits the same keyboard , always and over again .
and then it was getting bigger and bigger and it &apos;s <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have fake in there ? &quot;
but how are you sitting in a mentally normal way ?
so , so all the things that came out to tony <unk> came out evidence for his clinician , he &apos;s been crazy for this new kind .
he came into <unk> entrepreneurs and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities are just in <unk> .
and i added up , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the the the the <unk> are always the most pervasive aspects of the .
it &apos;s also , like that , it was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend is to the rest of the world .
and as a result of this conversation , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m going to be the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a great war between east and west was <unk> , and that it was necessary to communism , and it was necessary to communism .
and even though the president of it , made of <unk> reasons , very well , very well , that &apos;s not the enemy , it &apos;s nonetheless , a natural impulse to call the other side as an enemy .
when the treasure in 2000 sank , you saw the peak of the best <unk> that scientists had ever been the <unk> for african penguins -- that at this stage as endangered art .
and then after we arrived , two of us were going to be two of us with the truckers of space , and two times more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we used this technique in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because african penguin was written by a endangered way of the .
at the 42,000 mile , at the <unk> , before a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police police .
people are open for the <unk> .
so we launched this campaign -- very fun -- &quot; every <unk> . &quot;
this is not a <unk> of the second grade .
these <unk> came out , abstract .
hillel hired himself to a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not to your neighbors . that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest are commentary .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> <unk> and puts it careful of his father and the two men see each other than divine .
and this is the kind of cells in the biology and science drawn into the biology and look at the living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand is a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of the <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at all the same in the inside , you believe me .
the walls are 700 inches thick thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s on the left is an x-ray .
it has human association .
in x-ray , we &apos;re seeing all the little <unk> in the corners .
i had to the car in the middle , for you , never really easy to do .
yes , you &apos;ve given 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they only used to be a toilet .
the science is actually , we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i <unk> a <unk> .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not asking us .
not a professor and <unk> , only two spirits , ready to <unk> .
and then my life was okay .
everything i saw in the way that it was right to the <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
so would we have time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time , a billion dollars -- they &apos;re going to hear right — to study a billion <unk> <unk> , which was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later on that later .
then there &apos;s still dan dictionaries .
we were struck these shell quickly had their <unk> <unk> , and the most important in london companies were very <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all dying . we &apos;re all going to be the old . we &apos;re all going to get sick . people are leaving us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go and think you can &apos;t think of the world you can &apos;t inhabit the longer .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of i think they &apos;re the foundations of a new <unk> .
it has made the decision to get out of a <unk> or <unk> , but to make it a child that this is not a different girl .
we are all refugees .
but you put me this thing on the head , and then it happens .
but this doesn &apos;t do . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find it , but he didn &apos;t know his employees , but they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to be fired and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the <unk> loved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on the box box , which is the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
the characteristics that the the word childish are so often in adults , we should be able to criticize this old old word when it comes to criticize , and to criticize the behavior that with <unk> and <unk> thinking .
if i <unk> the ability to my sister , the 10 percent interest i &apos;m going to pay back to her last loan , i am going to get my ability to get more money from me until they paid it back .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not living in the dark ages .
and the third of all these sounds are all sounds that we create people who are <unk> .
this is after selective <unk> .
there are many <unk> of the grains , including the way animals that dance and sing , they i &apos;ve been taught for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much this is , this <unk> is 16 kb here .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the issues that are actually in the heart .
one generation that makes as much as video games , as a real world .
these are the problems outside of my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of the video games are in the video of the video .
end ! end ! that &apos;s it .
it would be very good at him .
so , you get quickly from the simple to complex , if you do more power . we like that .
and then you look at them , and the pain -- i thought that at least long time until she explained to me , that was to be a little bit of <unk> , so you think about it .
it &apos;s going to be driving .
girl : there was a sphere , and a <unk> , because there are two very different <unk> , and if you drop them out , they may be <unk> .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
and then we will change ourselves as we as we change the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do you do what they do ?
everybody would want to want to the new version .
they &apos;re very much to us .
they &apos;re actually going to be in that time .
i &apos;m going to put his words back right in the order .
&quot; well , &quot; well , i said , &quot; strange , you &apos;re asking this .
she said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t need to do again again . &quot;
we looked at us , and i was grateful , because she said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s awesome . &quot;
the goal of the project is quite easy .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is the problems of the project , problems that shouldn &apos;t have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change , not quite if an <unk> engineer has the answer .
you can find new solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s just easy and easy .
yes , you know , you know , you know my guys , i &apos;m wearing my life , because <unk> once was about <unk> <unk> .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t challenged them to draw some nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; i have a lot of the to the audience with the audience .
we have a lot of time on the existence of the animals that we &apos;ve been here so far , to reach the second microbial age .
his effect is the distribution of this very thin <unk> across the planet , and we had a very <unk> death of dinosaurs that beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and <unk> and so much else here and so much .
it &apos;s the ultimate <unk> , the <unk> of his time .
they hate us .
this is when material comes out of the depths of the earth and the surface , spread across the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast away , what will happen to me ?
they have a crash . you have two choices : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re taking the hydrogen sulfide and , we say , 75 percent of them will be rescued , mentally .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of you are countries who think that deregulation or all don &apos;t have the best way to attract investment , to promote investment .
the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as a chemical , and don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them together to build a solution . &quot;
they need a secure environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new kind of way of the national international task .
human rights , to a very simple question , can i be able to get to this person to be ?
or you know , to the young , the the first set of fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and it &apos;s light .
again again , we saw the spoken word poetry walls .
after the battle , he paused his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot , when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students do their third step , but i was lucky to see her , their journey evolved as much as she did .
my parents , i called sarah , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some ideas about some ideas that have driven me to become a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for each of these had such incredibly far-reaching consequences , and that the <unk> would actually be a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a a <unk> .
at the same time , in south africa after nelson mandela had been released from the prison , the black population was the last phase of the liberation of apartheid apartheid .
the next day i made myself in rwanda , and it was like i was going to hell in the <unk> .
after the fall of <unk> , i began to study the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to the <unk> .
a hospital of the doctors without borders , &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> is so efficient , the proportion of the soldiers who survive a <unk> in this war is much higher than in any other in our history .
so to make sure that as little as possible can be wrong , we have all this procedure to be .
so you select this way .
but that &apos;s a large and pretty difficult topic , so i had to cut my own .
the size is the size of the population -- here &apos;s great china , here &apos;s great india .
and all of the east religions , except japan was the same level .
because the death of a child will be a child with another child .
and what &apos;s the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all the other other our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
day eight .
in india alone , my <unk> best friends and i was with this same picture , to every single house in india , and we did a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them those questions they want to ask them .
i think we owe to the 20th and ron st. john , very much gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there &apos;s the founder of particle .
larry brilliant : first , isn &apos;t you pissed off the injury of the players ?
have a <unk> , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with an led that it would have used with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are pretty difficult to be pretty difficult , and we had this conversation in the company .
a <unk> <unk> is paid themselves in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 <unk> in <unk> , 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close this gap and to the high management .
there was a real equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not feeling .
this is , he wrote , &quot; is the mythic structure of reality . &quot;
someone who thinks it makes you kind of a kind of <unk> , and then it makes you steam up to the ears .
and then we realized our <unk> , we realized this openness .
like i was like , i would return to a bangalore , and often vibrant discussions with my friends , where they discussed different themes while they &apos;ve discussed <unk> over new <unk> , where a drink is a pill to be more than what they paid their 14 years old <unk> .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said he wants to improve the lives of his child child child child child child child child child child .
this <unk> was quite happy , and it didn &apos;t have any deaths , even though had killed dozens of liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media media is so bad job , that a small group of activists in the position is to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the <unk> .
j yeah . this was the cover of the guardian and it &apos;s been in all countries around kenya , in the <unk> and south african press .
j the implications for people who worked on it was a lot .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i was interested in , just because of what we &apos;ve heard about -- i am curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful about the term hackers .
and just a month ago , this was all passed from the <unk> parliament .
and from all these numbers , i &apos;ll start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very different , depending on where you &apos;re going to <unk> .
first , i read about this in a complaint with a <unk> , and the between the <unk> for responsible medicine and seven <unk> .
so , according to this research , the best <unk> for a chicken for a chicken , but not even in the way it &apos;s going to be black , and a <unk> of lemon <unk> , <unk> sugars or saltwater .
and then the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. <unk> on the <unk> in fort <unk> , texas .
and this insight is incredibly for the effectiveness of chemotherapy , maybe for many different types of different types of cancer .
for example , thought-controlled organic compounds compounds that are found in our schools , care and the workplace .
because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately called a voice , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
difficult !
one prosthetic is no longer for the need to offset .
we &apos;re all different perspectives .
i was in the <unk> of the olympics , it was a .
about 80 percent of these <unk> , young people , under 30 .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of europe and america of the products that they &apos;re in .
they have a kind of tools that you can &apos;t take them on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like <unk> .
so people think about asking questions : are we going to continue to be a greater of gdp on the world of a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the series of course , we haven &apos;t even been <unk> , so they &apos;re the first ones that get this to see this .
it &apos;s more similar to the more similar than earth , it seems to be the same as the same .
sousa was afraid of that , that we have the opportunity to lose , quote , &quot; they would take them .
but more importantly , that bmi generally used the same domain of creating the new <unk> of the , which they were free to their clients , and then in 1940 , as a <unk> , the majority of the fees , increases the majority of the .
and i ...
for the <unk> , i &apos;m trying to get out of my <unk> , of course , i &apos;m trying to ask a good liberal of the government . a mistake , right ?
this insight is incredibly <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert to note , but i just noticed that the person is right next to you .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look at that in that , no . &quot;
but another study was that strangers are going to lie in the first 10 minutes of your own .
here &apos;s koko her kittens .
i &apos;m going to say it again .
now , not a liar &apos;s a liar &apos;s eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the heads .
science has been very much more connections to daylight .
look closely , and you &apos;ll see the same video of the <unk> smile .
in this way , a lot of <unk> world can be a bit more explicit in terms of our moral set .
and that &apos;s not right now , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world where we live , and i &apos;m not true .
so what &apos;s when <unk> , if not tragic joke about harry &apos;s <unk> , <unk> than ethnic <unk> .
six months after that , without any explanation , they let me free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing is .
when i was 10 , i was <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> country , &quot; and on this book , i was broken .
a new song i i hit you .
so i took a little time to coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you have to tell you the incentive to do their actions in these remote villages ?
don &apos;t be as attractive as a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re waiting to be a <unk> .
a lot more people would have been bitten .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things , first , what we lost , and secondly , how we get to .
here you can see the greatest part of the living in the <unk> of florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing on a reef , because it &apos;s legally protected , or <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , eat the sea urchin , and then growing the algae again .
you can see the boundary of the <unk> , because there are all the boat .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s just like , it &apos;s what &apos;s it ?
so the protection is the waste and the seas too to a sink to provide the resources of governments and <unk> facilities , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
we found out the main reefs that is the pyramid of the equivalent of the equivalent of the <unk> , where five lions come on a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , thank you , you know , you &apos;re a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it &apos;s been the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the windows and see a little bit into the submersible .
and amongst other things , we &apos;re trying to get our partners in woods hole , this virtual world -- this world , this sort of pristine area -- into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a mouth . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen before , was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the <unk> .
these worms are growing up several centimeters in the week .
the concept of the <unk> is futile .
and the rest of the one percent are <unk> to the formula that you can use it in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , the <unk> , measurements , <unk> , axles , and that &apos;s .
students have to these principles . they have to formulate it .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the <unk> end of the <unk> .
what &apos;s the small hadron collider ?

so i made collections of images , cut , and i added them into <unk> .
a <unk> implication of it is that you &apos;re always a part of his picture , and this leads to a very free structure .
and i sometimes have a emotional reaction on news , as the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .

they have gone in a moment .

i want to talk about something that i &apos;m going to call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours , what i do .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the <unk> of these these these are so big that we can see a single neutron with this technique .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and its resolution can actually , you can actually <unk> all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
so , if i take this -- -- -- -- you know , a few seconds , you would be uncomfortable ; it &apos;s longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the auditorium .
they all realized . and this is the melody that the time in the world is to hear about the world &apos;s most frequently in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
as we cross miles and miles from <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
so as i &apos;m here today , i &apos;m talking about the <unk> of about five years .
just a mile from a mile from the coast of feet and depth meters meters .
the ocean determines climate and weather , they hold the temperature , and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> there are easily ...
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know that there &apos;s boundaries for what we &apos;re going to take the oceans .
in the last three years , the u.s. for example , the u.s. <unk> <unk> sea is protected as protected .
we need <unk> , new technologies to the ocean exploration .
a lot of my early career i wanted to find out how the wings of insects to hold enough power to hold themselves in the air .
let &apos;s explore this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual <unk> of a mouse from the lab by jeff <unk> , and you can see the amazing images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they <unk> a <unk> to make any behavior , another <unk> has a different <unk> and pattern and you can think that this is in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
it &apos;s home and drinking tea .
and when you &apos;re looking at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to look at it from louder components , and <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many per <unk> tree is there ? where are they going to put ?
we can look at the tissues , and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , each individual in its own activity , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the mysteries of the brain will be solved . mental illness , memory , perceiving -- they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and it &apos;s a <unk> you with a supercomputer that &apos;s going to find the brain with <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force began to build smaller models , and i started this .
this is what nasa did to get a <unk> to the mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom one is ? yellow .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has something to do with the culture .
the countries on the right , those who are very much , they have slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it gets back to get more complex .
a online <unk> online for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really know our <unk> .
in fact , in the medical , this is what we do in medical .
and waves are limited .
infrared -- can you use the eyes to the <unk> of energy .
their intensity can become very quickly , and it can become very fast off .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have cars and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> stop that can communicate with cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s really mean , which is life .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the <unk> of the genome , and it makes a personalized medicine that &apos;s better than the today -- it has no effects effects .
it &apos;s really simple -- just <unk> genes -- but we could totally synthesizing it completely synthesizing it .
we &apos;re not going to run as small organisms alone in the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we contaminate us or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the episode of us that have been made .
now i &apos;m mostly here because it &apos;s a kind of <unk> in the dog dog dog dog , at the moment where we have a a dog , the first , is through introducing a dog , first , with introducing rules , human rules .
they just like this , &quot; <unk> , &quot; just too , and therefore they &apos;re beaten .
no , we &apos;re doing , &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- bam , can be able to get to 10 to 10 .
they are like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , then you should not be it .
not only with the puppy , but with the rest of the family .
these are just as easy .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill is going to work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about energy to work with energy .
because , although i used scientific terms , in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very difficult to sound .
and even even even when it comes to be accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 percent with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert <unk> itself is a mile or two per year .
and homo erectus provided the same tool over 30 generations .
you can teach them in the lab , practice a little bit of <unk> , and there &apos;s also a <unk> of other animals , but the exchange of an object on another never never never happens .
it &apos;s wealth ; where the satisfaction of your needs to save time .
we &apos;ve done that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence that there &apos;s no evidence .
and when people started to start objects like this far , it was a hint of a trade-off between groups .
but who knows how to make a mouse mouse ?
but that &apos;s me , because of the connections , people are going to take people , and they never have a chance of the ideas to meet and mate , and i &apos;m sure that the technology is going to be more and so on the <unk> and so the <unk> continue to improve .
this is as a <unk> building , and i &apos;ve added the liberty as compared to it .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these emotions , they &apos;re gone .
so , when we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , usually the fast development of the problem , as we can discover things that are constantly changing ?
i talked to -- you know this situation if you can &apos;t diagnose any pathology at the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we <unk> one of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , far <unk> rhinoviruses .
after 10 days of a time , a fever came back -- still a fever -- they have <unk> -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it didn &apos;t even sequenced it very often .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new . nobody else has seen it before .
a huge battery could already .
let &apos;s make something that fits the <unk> of the <unk> .
i brought a <unk> with dense density , a <unk> <unk> with dense density , and a molten salt in between them .
but david is young and smart , and he wants to build a <unk> , and he &apos;s building the first metal metal battery with this chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all of that ?
this video was taken in the <unk> <unk> . six miles off the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 feet beneath the sea .
and so quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i began to be <unk> , and i was interested in and how important they found that children are and how important they found that kids are discovering things , and they don &apos;t teach them , on an open way .
evolution is often as a way of seeing that one way we chose , but it represents a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this skip to phase of space .
our cities are endangered , there are many of them are on the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so , when we &apos;re talking about <unk> behavior , or language , as it &apos;s called the social social , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this expression also known as well as proud , came from jessica tracy , and they showed that the sighted people and young people who do , if they win a <unk> .
so i thought about it . you can see these people , and see how they get involved , you could get them to pretend , and then they would get involved in ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you &apos;re at the <unk> stage ? what the this little manipulation of , these tiny <unk> ?
this is what happens in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where can you really apply this ? that was of course , of course .
like that . people are kind of like their true . they &apos;re going to show themselves .
she was completely depressed , and he said , &quot; i have nothing to go . &quot;
you need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can affect the wider life in the big amount .
<unk> swimming <unk> to get to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ant , and they crawl into the brain , and they go up a blade of grass .
and you have to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think , richard and my importance of ideas that these ideas are not abused .
and of course they &apos;re essentially extinct in the time .
but amongst all these ideas that are going to be able to look at the world , they &apos;re a lot of toxic ideas .
and as we can &apos;t try and to demolish that , you know , to demolish them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international tour .
i know you will tell me , &quot; t. there are not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . no one familiar with the other .
you will see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to realize that this hasn &apos;t been going to be better , but that we should be better if it &apos;s about to answer the questions that you have to consider to consider the question and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she earns about two dollars a day , just a <unk> <unk> , and i told me that they &apos;re not married to marry children before these things are done .
after all , despair , they went and <unk> a wise woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , when you &apos;re angry , you will be the best talk you ever become regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the interconnection of everything and unity of everything , and the basic value was respect , kindness to strangers .
who fights while he &apos;s going ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , turkey , in syria .
and so , and so , and more and more <unk> , and for recently , you have a income to support their family .
just go to somebody with someone , with another culture , from another country , and somehow , in a different <unk> , and they engage it in a conversation ; they hear him .
i &apos;ll start with where the story began in 1985 .
today morning , before you <unk> , who had a shower for a showers ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these are the less famous houses where 50,000 people live alive , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
so 21 percent of what we repair , are the consequences of <unk> , things that are actually going to be in the right now .
we did it . it &apos;s got a <unk> .
we found later that in this region , the cause of disease and death .
one thing is in the context of everything we did , the middle of the <unk> said nelson mandela , not too far from here , &quot; how to be slavery and apartheid , is poverty not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t even bother if you call me a <unk> .
it sounds really <unk> to say that from the top of this , but when you try to apply it , it &apos;s been impressive .
and with that statement , i am doing to you , in the belief that children don &apos;t leave their community to live in a better .
this is the youngest <unk> in america in america with our <unk> bronx .
this is a picture of mayor of the bronx that the children in his house , not in jail , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re large kids with small <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these accountability under <unk> , which is incredible .
now , you may wonder about these children .
hold kids from this shops .
stephen ritz : a teacher who <unk> the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even as a <unk> of the difference here is an increase in the <unk> &apos;s increase directly after this sharp line .
to 10 : <unk> suffered the pig &apos;s pork .
people with migraine headaches , with migraine headaches , a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we now have this now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- an <unk> acronym -- for treatment other <unk> .
lawyers have been on <unk> <unk> in the hope of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the poor patients , the poor patients full of pity .
and a year and a half ago , four of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is called &quot; <unk> &quot; means &quot; the <unk> .
where do you know what are really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i first time to get it to get it to come here .
these people are going to call the barrier , because they &apos;re really going to be able to share with the world .
they have to be able to develop connexions and to be able to develop its <unk> and <unk> , who teach the world around the world to teachers .
yes , books , which may be sold 100 or 1,000 dollars a year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise you all like it , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very difficult .
the days of the <unk> are over , when people say , &quot; well , we would like to have three or <unk> from it in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a few thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and this is the <unk> .
you click on things and stare at rocks . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better option . &quot;
we all play on &quot; i love lucy , &quot; on a big line , made of information and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you .
i think most people think that a woman who are blind , always their child .
it &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
one is the one that prevent <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance at the age of four to 22 years , you take in childhood to what this chart shows . it &apos;s in the early youth .
the idea that her father is singing in the public , and it was enough to be <unk> .
this is the <unk> of the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the <unk> <unk> museum in the field to install it in its lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that it stayed online , 24 hours a day , for nearly nine years .
but in the night , while we <unk> , i was the <unk> , like the <unk> decided that they would kiss sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in the <unk> .
honestly , i have no idea what it has been with shepherd , but they &apos;re immensely <unk> .
the first thing you &apos;re going to see is the terrible force of the <unk> .
he wrapping it up to my leg , grabs me up , tears to a car and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about it . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct <unk> with the world .
it &apos;s just as simple as a metaphor of memory , but our brains are not a perfect <unk> of technology .
it &apos;s the <unk> of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you , corn is in all kinds of things .
you should know that in every community , the number of the <unk> is already increasing .
i led three <unk> to antarctica .
but tell me where they &apos;re arriving and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we as the rest of the world are faced with a problem .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open seas , but the <unk> , everybody would like to look at it , in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific with giant <unk> and giant <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , automatic <unk> available for free to be available to a lot of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , not the answer , but if you &apos;re a geek like i , you say , &quot; well , what are the data tell us ? &quot;
instead , he has very carefully documented what happens when technology is the first time in a community , and it seems to be in a community .
so there &apos;s it , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> paintings .
i mean , this was at least how it was me happy .
well , there was a question that i was there a bit of a question that i was like to <unk> , you know , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it &apos;s from the front .
they &apos;re facing a terrible situation without the end of the direction .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> in hospitals .
as a <unk> , for example , i was seen as i was gifted , i memorized the <unk> , and i know how to use it , and i know how to use it , and i quickly work with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen this value of the elderly in so many of my friends , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 90s , are still active than <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
when christian <unk> was made and made of <unk> <unk> , young men in the u.s. and canada , <unk> , and superman , who are also back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> europe europe .
the largest guy guy , <unk> , don &apos;t want these rocks themselves . so he &apos;s trying to prevent them to the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when the article comes out ? &quot;
<unk> : there &apos;s got to something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when one group itself was an extreme .
<unk> <unk> : islam <unk> superheroes .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing with this , i discovered something curious about myself .
so you have the eye and then come to the concepts .
but of course , china has a massive population .
but what this is is , is that this kind of visualizing information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure of them to you , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project in britain .
why does it smells like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a to work on a less .
now after a few months of the , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same .
this is the basis for the machine that these two people built .
you made it -- and it just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , there are a series of things in the way i want to pay attention to them .
and she didn &apos;t really think about the context of the context that she was landed in it .
norman !
i said no one goodbye , neither my mother , my father , my my brother , my brother , my aunties , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports from this . i just just to say , i was two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do , and that one was to find my family and the other thing that was to write poems .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us in the air and there is little bits .
he had a <unk> , and then i have to be <unk> by others , female and probably a lot smaller family have been <unk> to achieve his age of 12 years .
is that a good kind of evolutionary adaptation , or will it be the mutations that exists on earth &apos;s the world &apos;s shortest earth ?
but will we do that , or we will make the world over their course ?
one day , a few weeks or a year , or maybe a year later , i was going to buy a store for <unk> , i wanted to buy a <unk> -- we had a <unk> plan .
it meant a basic change for me .
my one : about 70 layers of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how to i really am , this project , i &apos;m just going to be so far , i was going to buy a chinese newspaper from the <unk> in san francisco to buy the bird with a chinese .
when we take away the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , there was a perfect <unk> : sun , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too difficult . &quot;
and if you ever get again , it &apos;s just with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember my father in the wheelchair , and i was blown up from the top up to the down to the bottom , and i was the sun on my face .
they said to me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was to me and i called the school , i called <unk> and said i &apos;d like to read a <unk> book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and daddy ? were never up there .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m doing in my work .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> that flies through a richard serra .
how to hell , i &apos;m going to do a phone in three weeks , if i &apos;ve developed these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be like to hang on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayers in british .
i &apos;m looking at individual <unk> and how they &apos;re flowing -- how they expand and flowing . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s made of aluminum , than opposed to aluminum , than , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car in the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you put it into contemporary architecture , it feels totally naturally for me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made of kevlar .
and i was the same after my my , i had the lucky to study a member of a <unk> that was used for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be blind to the red light , and you can see it without being seen without being seen without being seen .
so they use it to eat and get mates .
i urge you to call a different science that has been used hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself to rediscover the value of the <unk> .
and on june , 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the wheel that was my life , and the duck was going to cover a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of <unk> on the lives of birds .
so , if i like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i <unk> it , i can hear music with music and <unk> .
one of them is &quot; i have a <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
now , you can see , you &apos;re more more and more more and more common , that the <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used against . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers want to get to enforce ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t dare the law . why dare you dare to law ?
it &apos;s like freedom to have a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and the biggest change : we have to be the authority to the mimicry and deployment of the law .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will suffer very soon .
<unk> boundaries for the interest , you can calculate the <unk> , and for the fees they can take .
now , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he only had a <unk> of the end .
but the problem of rules and incentives , it &apos;s because they &apos;re doing professional activity , and they <unk> the professional activity in two ways .
so , smart <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any intelligent <unk> can get to for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for free .
so why did this idea spread ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to turn to the mindset to something more more accurate , which we have -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we have to do it with a complete scale .
what i want to show you is what it needs to transport 21 pounds high to transport .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we get down and get the trucks you just saw somewhere here in the morning .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , you &apos;re overwhelmed by the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from someone who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> , is the fact that it was difficult to america .
there are a lot of black sheep out there that have been doing the wrong things and the problems still .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous environment environment .
imagine you , we could , because if we could reach it , we could achieve more .
governments governments that are the most progress , governments are the ways to enable shared value in the business , rather than the government to see the actor &apos;s the actor .
i may be able to go here , i can look at the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come to come back to the 19th century , very closely at june 24 .
we certainly could be so productive , if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they started <unk> on the british government to get money for building of babbage &apos;s machines because they believed that this machines would have tremendous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t allow us to do the research , but they also <unk> to look at the <unk> , rather than answering the <unk> of the <unk> , rather than answering questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned about life .
so , if you start looking at the very little stuff -- this person wrote a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , that &apos;s bacteria . &quot;
and all of the ones that are not old enough , you have no idea how this infection happened -- because through these <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs residing .
this would be the rate in which you &apos;re in the 26 letter of the <unk> in one by random chosen monkeys can find text .
everywhere , where life is , you will have this distribution , versus the distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop asks : &quot; are you safe ? hey , buddy , you &apos;re sure you lost that you lost ? &quot;
this is the data from one survey in the <unk> in a single district in zambia , a few years ago i &apos;ve got to <unk> .
as you see , bruce willis at the time , bruce willis at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it fitting in my plan , and i wasn &apos;t just on vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the paper paper on the cell phone , we should develop software that allows you to do this , without exercise and without my <unk> .
this is less than i earned at the time when i visited for two weeks as a consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory trajectory , or in the balloon , we have to change the altitude .
this can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need to <unk> .
i promised me that i &apos;m going to take the next time , if i was going to fly the world , no fuel will take away , or not being driven by fossil <unk> to be safe , not from the <unk> threat .
i think you need a pilot on the plane who can talk to the universities , to speak to students , while the flight can be talking to politicians during the flight , and it really can do it for a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is why all people who believe in this spirit of self , welcome to be part of this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , it &apos;s always , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is what this problem is , and what it &apos;s not .
this is crazy , really , when you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second with that nonsense .
in fact , we &apos;re the first generation of disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see over the ocean , they say it , and you do it . we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the <unk> states that are engaged and the history of the world .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign , as our chute , my organization , the data , and other groups of the energy and enthusiasm that from hollywood to the into upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate in upstate
step step forward , a nurse , a nurse , a a <unk> , a <unk> and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has all its lives has changed a country -- and a continent that has just been to analog to analog , let alone -- i just shook my head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
and your job is to realize that this shapes bouba is and what is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , then this sentence , literally , is , literally , wrong .
if we explore a problem or something new , we compare what we already know about what &apos;s not known to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these manifestations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how about it , you personally , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was a half time to the big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you &apos;re probably going to land in intensive care .
but soon , i showed symptoms of the symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i &apos;d never see my home again .
i was sitting there , and i was talking about the <unk> for the journal , and i asked him what i would do , if i would take a transplant , to prepare for me .
i was hanging out of a dozen machines that kept me on life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> are also in the u.s. to 200 percent .
and also , interesting is that the same companies sold to atrazine , which is sold to atrazine , which is also sold -- a and the same company .
we also started as <unk> .
what would our kids say to us , if you had every day again , i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit about a <unk> a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , in oakland , most of our villages , this connection is not .
this is the accumulation of the <unk> <unk> to the airport airport by los angeles .
i would give five cents for every <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of you are behind them .
they look like their <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge amount of surface that extends into the sky because they tend to something that you call <unk> -- <unk> .
<unk> to the the skyline of stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely <unk> to see that .
but recently , all the doors are torn up and the walls are carrying up .
that was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s take for example , first of all the time .
how do these infected computers , then they get money with these infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- how <unk> works -- and try to find a way , the <unk> that we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that they can see a <unk> there , <unk> / d / <unk> and when you open this file on your computer , and then you get this program and performed .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the mark of the mercedes <unk> is .
we have to make some way to ensure that everything keeps playing , even when the computer are .
but i didn &apos;t have to do with that .
this person connected with guns .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future looks like ?
this powers completely , no one &apos;s <unk> 2011 .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of calculations would take seriously , and they would be , because this would change things , but it would change things in two types of ways .
that means that we &apos;re going to see a copy of self , if you &apos;ve used a part of the <unk> , this in slow <unk> and a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> and saw that their video was suddenly spread like a <unk> .
thank you .
you will go into the distance .
this is what it was taught to do was to do it since it was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor , like <unk> , who taught me how to <unk> .
what &apos;s it driving you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t that -- time . didn &apos;t mean -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager .
at this moment , consciously , or unconsciously , in the moment , you &apos;re going to focus on you , you can sense of meaning , and whatever it means , it makes emotions .
have you ever done it , and i went to mit , &quot; i was . &quot;
to death . so god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through prayers , through <unk> , through <unk> .
and there are seven different beliefs , i can &apos;t pass it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in <unk> in <unk> , someone died in new york who died when he would have been working on the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist , and it clearly clearly .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools that can tell the great number of people who are people around the world .
the color of particles is the kind of feeling -- happy , positive characters have bright colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day of the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , i start walking the list , and there are thousands of sentiments that were collected .
the ten themes of the rays and circling the time capsule .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this as a as betty ford ford , like she kisses the box of her husband .
you can also look at quotes , if you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people see clouds as something that &apos;s in the ways .
in the life . it has tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries across the earth .
you just need a step out outside , and to look at that , so mundane is so banal , all the other one .
so look at them , admire the authentic beauty , and remember to wear the head in the clouds .
they &apos;d have 25,000 recordings of paper that would have this , &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> , to buy my first <unk> , and it was a huge machine .
these images from a virtual autopsy .
you can see here how knife is invaded in the heart .
it &apos;s a smaller , mechanical pen that has very fast <unk> into its inner , very fast <unk> .
so this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very talented people .
i went to kids as many as possible to the academic fabric to connect the academic world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to be in detail , and why we think the universe is so , but it &apos;s the math and try to explain physics that we know .
and in my career , i always <unk> something in my career .
in 2001 , i visited her during a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the one after the first degree of 2004 .
he &apos;s just before before before the <unk> , and i was shot with someone who you all know .
each will be a <unk> <unk> , but to be different disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager , and it was a really great contraption .
and he &apos;s exploring the brain through mri and he said this is the beautiful brain that he ever did .
so , the next few slides i &apos;m going to show you this .
transistors are getting smaller to enable this and that &apos;s what our technology has significantly better .
and our <unk> is the lens here .
i had a gut feeling that we &apos;re going wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what &apos;s a schwarzschild radius radius .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more in our galaxy , we can see more detail than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy because you could put a lot of stuff there in it .
it pulls on a side of a much more powerful than the other and the cloud will rent apart apart .
and i hope that i &apos;m at least i &apos;ve convinced you that we really have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was going to the streets of new york , and saw some kids between walking and <unk> <unk> .
for example , the people like the <unk> century , the way that have been so broken .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what &quot; in the first eight centuries of the , &quot; god , to praise .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the <unk> .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and emotions throughout time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new <unk> .
and then to the year , in 1945 , it brought it to 100,000 annually .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , though i don &apos;t know where to begin .
wow , a volunteers , great .
but recently , my interest in was getting my interest in a new view of a new view of a new view of the world , there &apos;s circumstances where this something really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of a phenomenon we call crowd-accelerated innovation .
but the thing that &apos;s the desire is really the most important .
we get a fabulous talks back from you .
let me introduce this point sam <unk> .
but even if you look at the screen , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> as just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
like <unk> innovation promote innovation .
one : i have to be as a speaker of the audience to do a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying , instead of saying , what i can &apos;t do .
and they &apos;re fun fun to design your own , your own ultimate or worst .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugars , as a kind of <unk> , which we call the superpower .
these kinds of testing do this , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
and the thought he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there &apos;s three big changes , and in the areas of transparency , enable the choices and <unk> that people have really do truly .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , the moment , the <unk> , the world has more photos of their back of their back to each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , the fact , the teachers were looking at <unk> and tastes like helpful resources , because they were to specific areas that have a sense of sense in which is a <unk> sense .
so then i wish to all this a beautiful weekend .
reading to read and write it &apos;s always easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now , ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
if you have this kind of world , this is a <unk> , who allows to do the biotechnology .
the kingdom said , &quot; his laws allow him to strangers or <unk> , who are an economic risk or a <unk> or a risk of health or the <unk> of the state .
these laws are a slap in the face of science and is based on prejudice and ignorance and a self-assembling <unk> .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> people are injecting drugs .
so the social worker that were condoms at endangered <unk> , not even being tracked by the police , <unk> or <unk> .
here were children born , people died there .
office for personal work are already obsolete now .
they cleaned up the line , the street , the stream down below the street , and you get from a end of <unk> to the other without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in a little apartments . &quot;
also jobs should be shared .
their liver is <unk> oil .
and they kill the 12,000 sharks at the time , by looking at a <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> bay in the island island .
we know very little about it .
so this is the <unk> is the place of a shark , depending on the time and the sunset that the temperature and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of what the genes are going to be passed on by the parents , we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , one of the factor of 10 less diversity than other people .
so , <unk> <unk> this research and found out that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . there &apos;s no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build on this . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can tell the geneticists , whether it was a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
your body will be cracked by <unk> , and they &apos;re being used for any <unk> , to make money -- people tell many such stories .
no business with anybody .
my journalism may not be in other continents , or in other countries , in my part of africa , it works , it &apos;s about corruption , ask people immediately , &quot; where are the validity ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks removed from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be as <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victims of their <unk> ?
these days , in 29 states , over half of the country , because of its sexuality are being fired .
and at some point i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was wrong with you , because there was a million different <unk> of the gay .
at least i hope that it becomes harder , your human rights .
one : the world is , and it &apos;s always going good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had been used to the soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing type of action is .
this is stanley jim , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust going to happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord who is responsible when he &apos;s going to be responsible for him ? &quot;
stanley prestero and i closed both the high school , by the way , james <unk> in the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> .
alexander <unk> says that the line between good and evil through the heart of one every person .
and i put the experiment in the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the rails .
it &apos;s a mystery that really difficult to do it .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a <unk> , which is through the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying anything about it , except that it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
and the autobiographical self even has extended recollection , think imagination creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the hip -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m going to tell you , and i <unk> , because i think feminism has part of the task , to embrace the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
you &apos;ve now , you can see , i didn &apos;t let me .
she talked about <unk> , she started <unk> , it organized <unk> , you <unk> friends -- all these everyday acts and creativity .
i mean , i mean , it &apos;s this <unk> that is the homo sapiens from the former <unk> .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that read the electrical activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we <unk> numerous prototypes and products to live that you can control with the idea of how <unk> appliances or a <unk> chair .
the communication is wireless with an ipad or smartphone .
how to turn your new awareness of their recovery , will turn to the very damaging and <unk> social <unk> , which people who are diagnosed as different , to see .
and she understood the power of human narrative and that value us to people , change and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate your ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunity .
so , the very unexpected , they gave them up .
this specialist , that didn &apos;t have to look at my eyes .
i was going to go on a track i know good .
and it &apos;s very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in myself , not really , all of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . i i i am .
what we have is the same thing , the same thing , but in one of them , they &apos;re great , and in others , with just a small change in the position , you feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that has to take place to be the measure of control , which we have about our tax .
for <unk> percent of this money , you could have been able to install them in their trains , which hasn &apos;t decreased the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the more powerful would have been improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the whole of the <unk> one of the other .
sometimes they are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is to be understood as a universal discipline to human psychology .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it will tell you that they &apos;re neither to hurt themselves .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years .
but it doesn &apos;t mean that i have a coin to two pages .
it &apos;s not difficult to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had <unk> , actually , very powerful effects in children around the world , and now with people ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , powerful , it wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i have <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> &apos;s <unk> that he &apos;s made completely in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s make a <unk> .
there &apos;s first one of the present self .
i have to give five pages on the day , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible to be that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you the last time time is something i made with hal <unk> , which was presented with my co-author with a previous project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not affected by people , because when one of the faces smiles , then the other face is frowning .
this is one of the reasons that the most of what we &apos;re looking for western science , maths and <unk> , in the first few centuries of our <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not a <unk> .
so , as not as it doesn &apos;t surprise that when you talk about the psychiatric diseases , you probably talk about <unk> suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly all of the time .
a little more than 30 years ago , the nations in the world , and they gave the legendary explanation .
what &apos;s it going ?
if you look at the level of the species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
and you look at this profit , you can see that nearly 8,000 of this dollar &apos;s actually <unk> in a really .
this was in the early <unk> , when india wanted to take a <unk> of his <unk> -- as a drug to the recovery -- after china , with his <unk> growth from eight , nine , 10 percent , and said , why can &apos;t we do that ?
it makes them no lucky , but they have trust and the courage and the courage to say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon is producing 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things that doesn &apos;t mean , including , by the way .
i liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he was essentially exactly the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color that just covered these fantastic <unk> .
many of these ideas boxes in the developed , the <unk> trailer .
if you think about their kids to tinkering school , they will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let them play it with their own conditions , and trust me , you &apos;re going to learn to learn about <unk> of the <unk> .
if you want to throw the next thing to get away , you don &apos;t .
i think that &apos;s all this is . this is number <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick knees on the left , and here my wife in the time , four months after , in aspen , and in good health .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven that the <unk> that haven &apos;t been shot up .
and so it came to the years of the <unk> western europe , to buy first , and then thousands and ended up with millions of thousands of a little paper that should bring up a in the middle of the hell .
but how does our imagination works ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
and as edison , as edison , the light bulb , it looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be dumb and it &apos;s going to be able to bring it .
they literally have the door , literally the door .
if you listen to the <unk> of your <unk> listening to her <unk> , both ears are two .
we have the problem that the antenna <unk> .
even even thank you .
this reason is particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
i recently created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i drew her own personal map for each person , and he wrote their name on it , and they <unk> them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and limited life on this earth is exactly the same thing .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to hold its position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we think about the future of technology . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you &apos;re seeing it , you see the amino acids with the <unk> , where they have different charges .
and through a sequence of <unk> , you can grow one from a billion fish that &apos;s what you want to grow a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can see <unk> .
when you ask people the question : where do you go to , if you have to do something important ?
i sat on my desk , my expensive computers used .
what happens to -- sometimes you have a days that you wake up in the morning , or to to seven or when you get up , and you &apos;re going to get up , and you &apos;re like , man , i didn &apos;t sleep really well .
so in the office , most of the <unk> and distractions that people are doing from work , <unk> .
we all know that &apos;s true . you would never have a <unk> meeting , that &apos;s the staff will be calling .
meetings and managers are two main problems today , especially in offices .
maybe all the two weeks , or every week , once you know , <unk> , who nobody can talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this now seven years and have no idea how the future will look like .
but if you ask people to three main things they carry in , no matter what the culture and the relationship -- people say , the , the money , and if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very large but , we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
you take 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and then -- the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent of <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the bar on the bar on my family .
it &apos;s the norm .
and he kind of <unk> an recognition for the values of <unk> .
at the same time with these mobile devices , we &apos;re a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about it .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research , showing how the <unk> of healthy way to affect the genetic level , and he says , like , if we live healthier , more food , exercise and more , in more , our brain cells actually , in fact , our brain cells actually actually inhabit .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my own , i stayed at almost all the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth one .
i mean , even the dumb &quot; answer to all the &quot; <unk> , for days to let us go back for days .
and as i said earlier , i am a <unk> .
i thought i &apos;m in preparing to my ted wish to try to explain what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to fit this to what they &apos;re trying to do .
no one in india . now there are at least a million active at least .
and i thought that somebody came to the world of the world &apos;s the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did it that to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of whom were treated , they used to take their medicines or <unk> <unk> in the way .
it &apos;s a try and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
when the <unk> is used , it will generate 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people get their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the women of bali are eating food on <unk> and they use <unk> that are only their grandmothers .
we need someone who comes and it &apos;s studied .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal and <unk> were still healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was a reason for this : that was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but that &apos;s not about it .
at first , the internet was a <unk> tool , now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human , to ignore .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing turing test .
i was before , i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what you live ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> pages as a single page , because it &apos;s the reader .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind this ?
one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not running out of it .
it &apos;s <unk> and terrible things happened to me .
everybody lost hope to my cure .
so they went to their <unk> , and everybody would collect their <unk> furniture -- they gave me <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this street , and you don &apos;t know whether they go straight and and they &apos;re going to go straight and forth , and they had a terrible crash that you &apos;ve got into this position .
i thought , for some reason , for some reason , and only family and friends stop .
so for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me with the <unk> of <unk> .
can we argue , we would have discovered all symmetries the symmetries ?
i can &apos;t turn it around , because i have a little hurdle in it , right ?
if i take a magic train , and then there &apos;s another one , it makes a third .
galois has a set of laws of laws , like these tables , these symmetries , interact .
one of the symmetry we call <unk> .
instead , instead of all , i want to know how many digits digits . ok ?
i need your name your name . symmetrical objects , you can spell him for me .
one : poor nutrition , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison , in a software company , in a <unk> software company .
it was been in 1900 , but in 1940 , the bosnia were not made commercially and medically <unk> volumes of them .
it was the origin of the <unk> , the last year was his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences , that mess is happening now . let &apos;s make the best thing .
it works with every computer and browser -- minus , minus , minus , and the text becomes smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete it to you .
and so , this is a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by being , my my real desk .
a means it would be like a a drug object , so that you get into the traditional desktop . the things are <unk> on the grid .
now i get to my favorite , the heart of people , there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s a little bit , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re not <unk> the role of contemporary math -- not just <unk> , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists to the wall street , and i am one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flying , you may have to be on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; it &apos;s culture .
you can get it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually interesting as interesting .
go go . shake , etc .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without stop signals , so with <unk> , saving lots of lives , but there &apos;s a hybrid mating .
the answer is to allow cars to get to get the the street to get safely .
warren buffett was really recommended , to say what does it and and what not do this to a year .
in fact , we see the <unk> of the <unk> , that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the africa in africa , even more of the people that have been formed to avoid the <unk> .
this means that the economy in these areas , because it &apos;s just so much .
but that &apos;s not a <unk> thing that &apos;s not yet .
it wasn &apos;t only one ; it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s weaker .
a teacher at the upper quartile performance is its class -- measured at <unk> -- in a year to 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free classes could not only be available to the internet , but you can get dvds to have access to a very very best teachers .
ordinary vessels , like this cup , eight to 10 hours to be burning .
he &apos;s talks about the sculptor of richard serra , as he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in florence his graduate school in florence .
when i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to get the smoke on my clothes , when i was home to my family .
my parents responded great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s just let us go tomorrow tomorrow .
but is it so bad to hold us as powerful ?
this is a general general in boston .
and then , using the pathologist , it &apos;s a , <unk> it , it &apos;s looking under the microscope and then the the operating room .
so in this kind , a solution , a solution with these <unk> molecules , combined with a dye here , and in the <unk> of one cell , ordinary neurons can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with metastatic lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph nodes as part of our today &apos;s <unk> is looking at the individual node , the lymph node where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , it can cause it , and pain .
if we <unk> these two samples .
we know that this is feasible , and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is a thousand different constructs that we learn from .
it will affect the healthy circuitry of how the sick you want to fix them .
and one in the morning in the summer in the summer , we &apos;ve been doing it , and it &apos;s the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that there &apos;s already a quick light of these cells to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of the end of this , we think it might be a clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually , the walls and the little platform can be able to use his eyes again .
buildings are colonized with the air , the microbes that ripple through the windows and through mechanical <unk> .
and when they stop there , the air contains the air that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical very strong person as you see , so i don &apos;t worry about this thing to wear 20 blocks .
the same thing for the question , who after september 11th the streets in my neighborhood was alive in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve done is , is something called google share , you just take a abstract term and you &apos;re looking for google , and then you look for these results after the name of someone .
this is <unk> <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you &apos;re going to link one .
what was normal for us all about 40 years ago -- this is what about stories between generations -- is now rare .
so in 1939 , the film was older than most of our members of our members .

why don &apos;t we see this with the same passion as you read ?
in california , they &apos;re going to be sending up with a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that from the state of california , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we may be developing a <unk> of a <unk> , and it requires to my profession , is it a <unk> that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was like , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we &apos;ve gone out . &quot;
and this can be so true for berlin , but we put it on houston , and all the windows , and all the products that are obviously in low -- is this is a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
and since we &apos;ve since since we &apos;ve been the 4,000 <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to put in the public six weeks .
now we have a hundred pounds of heavy <unk> <unk> the internet internet .
we started commercial and mixed with buildings , so all people centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let anybody tell anybody we already knew it , because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , they &apos;re for example , the <unk> of microsoft &apos;s september september 11 , 2008 , the the 12th march of 2008 , and then the other : google , skype , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden are similar laws of how the united states has .
and whoever told you , he didn &apos;t have nothing to hide about it long enough .
their emails were read and she talked to the <unk> and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right to privacy , there can &apos;t be real freedom and therefore , and therefore , no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you see the first time a single human brain , say , &quot; usually look different , you can get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that are going through the animal .
and the nature of a particular cell , to make its own biochemistry , it &apos;s determined by the 25,000 genes turned on and what threshold they are on .
now experts get to play and make basic basic <unk> .
we take it , and put it on a <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
you look at their entire genomes and they try to find <unk> that are linked to the genes .
whether this is the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
we know how to eradicate poverty , we just have to do more for that ?
so here are a few questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
well , before it was the same .
and it &apos;s been a lot of experiments that would all come to the same conclusion , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to steer politics .
and maybe we start to start small , things that we &apos;re sure they &apos;re going to be .
poverty is more <unk> than scientific work and a lack of data on the effects of <unk> <unk> the question of how to be this -- but <unk> esther talked , it &apos;s possible to find out what <unk> and the damage -- with help .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the way .
and legend is that alexander &apos;s walking around these desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to discuss this from perspective of the <unk> .
in tanzania , last week , the standard of <unk> <unk> was .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 the <unk> of the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there &apos;s amazing opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we &apos;re all trying to be inspired and feel one with the universe , to feel that life .
you turn a switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought it .
i &apos;m going to run this , so that you can kind of able to be able to describe my reactions when i saw this for the first time .
right .
ok , change , raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i look at the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how many times you felt that ?
so let your eyes close , five , four , three , two , one .
only if you want the pressure released , they make a <unk> , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to try to do it ?
you &apos;re feeling a certain sensation , and if you feel the emotion emotion , i want you to throw the <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing that i want to share with you with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . think he &apos;s here , yes , or no ?
first of us , keith barry , how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a twist that works by <unk> , and then he acts the audience into some stunning <unk> of the brain .
i &apos;m going to <unk> .
this is not for the one of four legs . that &apos;s all four .
i observed that both religious as the people are obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost zero to zero , if there &apos;s no <unk> to <unk> .
they then get the following message of the computer , &quot; person has sent to you a lot of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is <unk> <unk> to 80 percent .
i just found the molecule to it .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments we have testosterone testosterone .
and this tells us that we created this ritual to connect us with this new couple of emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain to the <unk> .
to get the device to run , you need lots of people .
or should you not be about it ?
they said , pretty <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ve given a machine that &apos;s working in english , so we teach ourselves english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to disrupt my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
it &apos;s absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how will tomorrow be ?
we need to undo this imbalance , of threat to delight .
i think it &apos;s just the way to focus on .
i &apos;ve got a very , very , very , , when was the beginning of the world ? how is it going to end ? &quot;
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the boat .
<unk> went to the local <unk> , in uttar pradesh , and found that he was led to the official <unk> .
that &apos;s why this domain of <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer , which is able to pay multiple <unk> to numbers and multiple homes , are common .

and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from the sound of the chamber chamber .
or we &apos;re doing this and think that &apos;s blindness .
rain . don &apos;t bad . don &apos;t bad .
single <unk> <unk> , but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this <unk> <unk> , <unk> evelyn <unk> , why this is a lot of <unk> to be <unk> sound than sound sound .
and it was so big until the point where it was a <unk> last year , and he was thanksgiving <unk> , and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> , &quot; millions of people on tv .

and one day we met with the <unk> .
the elephant <unk> just and they took the <unk> .
i don &apos;t think anybody can accuse google , because google does the right thing , even if people use google al qaeda to connect with .
<unk> <unk> : a hero of the congo
we have almost without having noticed from a market to a <unk> .
you don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should be <unk> , what was happening with these experiments .
democracy needs no perfect equality , but it needs to share a common lives .
the u.s. in the united states , the u.s. 1900 , where the line is shifting .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and 80s , when women entered the <unk> .
and electricity was helpful to the emancipation of women .
an amazing thing for <unk> is that in the first half of the 20th century , the average expectancy is the life expectancy , as in the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i was a and i was a <unk> and i got a two + two .
i &apos;ve got some , and i think , between five and 15 should be my <unk> and led to a sense of failure .
so when i look at creativity , i think , is also this sense of the <unk> of the <unk> to the context that i see between practically everything in life .
this is what buddhist fishermen say , because they actually not kill any way .
and they will be more more .
and i had to find what to fit in the story .
how are we going to be <unk> , what are the accountability and the causes of a dish ?
and you have to be in all ways , including those who i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you look at this , if i &apos;m going to look at these examples , because i &apos;m talking about everything you could spend their time .
there &apos;s the magazines over water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is they have nothing in common .
the corners of <unk> , on the center , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys are the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you need to do is to find out who it &apos;s interested .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to go tahrir square , and it was a picture i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
mostly , the cultural heritage tends to look back and look back and the past .
my first recent story for national geographic , i realized that you can bring environmental problems in a documentary about the history of nature , i had to do it .
these are the lions and tiger the oceans .
and because i love sharks -- i was kind of obsessed with -- i wanted to make another , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need for sharks .
after i had to leave out , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new <unk> .
they also caught up in <unk> .
but the fish came back and again , and again the tasmanian population , growing forests of seaweed in the flat water .
it &apos;s now in the jungle of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , your second son , the the end of the second orangutans i have rescued , <unk> .
it was a biological desert .
then you can see the returns , and it &apos;s starting to measure what comes from .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need to use the nitrogen , and without any of these microorganisms , there will be no performance .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we really can change the climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect the own system .
the <unk> of <unk> , the one <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll show you one another .
<unk> <unk> creates sculpture , beautiful works that can move in patterns or <unk> waves , in nine minutes he <unk> us with his <unk> art -- same as inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has its own design .
23 years later , you asked to come and this idea of <unk> .
this is the italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese space , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist , or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something , but no , part of science .
people always say the mind always was difficult to define .
you can &apos;t doubt about the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we get the objectivity and subjectivity as the characteristics of reality and the characteristics of standards .
don &apos;t you ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they can &apos;t imagine , to do something else .
we teach no american story in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear any <unk> .
maybe later , it &apos;s not immediately .
no , doesn &apos;t do .
i couldn &apos;t work this thing to work , no matter how many times i am .
but we have to change from an industrial model to a <unk> shift where every single school morning can flourish in the morning .
so erez and i wanted to find more about this .
the reason for this is that the historic report is going to be part of the historical report .
there was a light on . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s seriously .
it led a group of students in the streets of the streets .
i stood up , i made a tea , and i sat down and everything , and i &apos;m still paralyzed , but here &apos;s still paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct <unk> you in the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; by the dictatorship of dictatorship to democracy with <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
and actually chris <unk> , and said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t make a lot . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i <unk> , is the largest culprits in this massive <unk> of the earth through humanity and the <unk> destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would &quot; -- what would &quot; -- what would &quot; -- what &apos;s &quot; -- we call it <unk> , where they call the impact , in the denominator -- let &apos;s call him <unk> , bring it to the <unk> , where you &apos;re the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge <unk> on the market that we have raised sales and win .
we literally won the <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i received an e-mail from glenn thomas , one of my people &apos;s meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us , i &apos;ve been told many of us who work in the industry , the industry is threatened by technology and possibly <unk> .
and indeed , we need someone to convey someone to us , so we have a experience with a mentally divine mine ?
the arts , whatever they do , the every time they &apos;re us to do , to look at our <unk> and wonder .
the three nurses ahn <unk> with their passionate music to be a new life , where tedwomen , you start with the joyful and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the manchester <unk> <unk> is named after my neighborhood .
he makes a bunch of money through the value of special for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken over the curriculum of the american <unk> , which is harvard the <unk> of the <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in this <unk> in the middle of the inner city in this <unk> in the middle of the inner city .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to give them flowers and get sunlight and and and herbie and herbie &apos;s music , and you can &apos;t heal the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from the world , the public schools , and that &apos;s what they are capable of affection and and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s all pretty good to work today .
and i &apos;ll allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell them to sell you to sell you a agreement that the money will be used for the aid . &quot;
this is a room that &apos;s built for nancy wilson &apos;s the morning of the school in our school , the christmas day .
the brown building is you looked at you , and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , this is a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people .
bill <unk> shares a quiet and amazing story of creation through art , music and unusual alliances .
and the transducer is then bringing the <unk> to the code of the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and that was our contributions .
they cover us with a invisible <unk> , the attacks of the environment is so that we remain healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and and they &apos;re all to be able to make these molecules , then the number of these molecules are outside the cell in proportion to the <unk> .
now we know that all bacteria can speak together .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is to the point that we &apos;re killing the motorized bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and that they can be able to live in their own lives , if they were only to act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to come to this conference .
or the first ones that come into the room .
but , if we think about justice , says , what we need to think is the actual character of the activity and qualities that are worth you that you are <unk> , <unk> and recognized .
what &apos;s a reason for a reason ?
charlie , what are you say to warren ?
here it is , like it <unk> .
this is aristotle , <unk> and the <unk> question of marriage marriage marriage marriage marriage was entitled .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic
a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> , for the rural guys , to tell us rural guys , to say what we &apos;re supposed to start with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of humanity is good to make a decision .
if that &apos;s like , what is that for us ?
i &apos;m going to suggest that the speed of the time is going to be .
i &apos;m like to suggest that is nonsense .
we know that this cusp , because we don &apos;t get complaints before we reach a <unk> age , and that even even though the damage was the damage since our birth .
that means you have to do their homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read somewhere that the last 20 years , the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet around 10 years .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they went into the center of <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t have a <unk> to the present , the <unk> , as the case i learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is something scary , and you probably know a part of the <unk> .
fourteen americans die a day of asthma , three lot of the same as the 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he was obviously sense to humor .
politicians and <unk> are afraid of being <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
secondly , because we &apos;ve been dumped .
so we thought , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do it . &quot;
there you find some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go off . &quot; and paid people to do every <unk> , who they saw .
he may be thinking , he would have the baby baby , so he &apos;s got some help of the outside .
i asked peter , peter , who did something changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we &apos;re going to start with &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and this is : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful african .
but mostly they have to be productive in their lives , and a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can get done .
we can we connect it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these people , and i was my my back to my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and often , i don &apos;t see african employees among them .
so the question is now how we use , are all this good will that we will come to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective a <unk> product , i took this case to study them , exactly how we can study any complex neurological process .
the way it was applied since the 90s to study very complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in change .
how do you study rap ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity there is something that is involved in <unk> .
i want to say to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
it &apos;s very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not just pleasant .
but keep the idea of the time for eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , their facial expressions of natural and intuitively are intuitively used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they blew very fast , and without a fixed grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children are going to die .
another one statement of esther was that we &apos;re reacting to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s created by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing to do .
we have every street , every village , almost every square square of madagascar .
in your <unk> , a very cheap laser .
audience : yes .
what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got all the time , we haven &apos;t been able to put the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant &apos;s restaurant house house .
this is actually actually growing up in a <unk> , which was turned on inside the outside , and it was <unk> .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still from .
the idea is not perfected .
you don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could give you this animal here .
and as soon as it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
and once we sequenced these two genomes , we said , if this is the smallest genome of a self-replicating genome to be a even more than even a smaller genome ?
and we know , we know , once it worked , and once it worked , a real chance of time , if we could get the synthetic chromosome to it , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is <unk> .
and the last one , a quote from robert feynman , &quot; which i can &apos;t relate to the self that i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , in the northwest part , we &apos;re going to live in the northwest , the actual notion of the koran , the <unk> of the koran , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , <unk> through by running streams . &quot;
but the more you add , the more likely to go .
and this number of 72 comes never before .
this is a nest a a wheels colony and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony which is now the one queen &apos;s now established in the last summer .
the <unk> -- this is a magnifying glass -- is an interesting group . they &apos;re going to go out in the morning before the first group of foraging .
oddly , oddly , it looks like half the ant doesn &apos;t do anything .
the nest nest are just taking all the <unk> , and they put them on the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put it there .
the the <unk> they don &apos;t choose to get out .
and we conducted experiments that have the longer ant faster away out , the more <unk> on their surface , and so that the ants smell by different ways that they do different .
they &apos;re all the entire earth off , beyond antarctica .
here you see , the cost of all of this is the cost of 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with it .
i thought , where we can use the natural gas .
and when i got to the <unk> , natural gas is nine dollars .
why does that worry ?
it &apos;s just 500 million <unk> .
it never got the groundwater , or similar .
tbp : i &apos;ve lost 150 million of the wind , okay ?
some people have 5,000 . many have more .
there was <unk> . and there was <unk> .
life is an event . you &apos;re going to say the world .
these are work in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first <unk> .
these were there in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be this thing .
a friend of mine told me this story : they weren &apos;t just waiting and wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , the first time , they had to call somebody .
and so i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so it may not be so warm to be about compassion in other conversation about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> are good for people who are going to be <unk> .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less less to use the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going to raise up . this is a game game .
each form of social dependence , <unk> , force , to acknowledge the humanity of others .
and you &apos;ll explain to you the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t be respected and they want to dominate them , and they hate america .
most diseases associated with poverty , but in case of cancer , the children who were in cancer , the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a half died a week , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t get this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
and so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant <unk> would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cancer cell and that this is a <unk> cell .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material that had the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , and then you see , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right , what we &apos;ve created in culture .
and of course , what are we now , we &apos;re going to ask now ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist who was caught in the <unk> , a young <unk> , whose book so many <unk> quotations that you &apos;ve taken it from the shelves ; a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise .
you &apos;ve got four good friends of a person who their personality .
it &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can lie to lie ; they were talked to lie , and then they were .
they said , how big the bath was a bath , or said , the <unk> are so far from the hotel .
woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , a photo !
and also , you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , how often i &apos;ve been from life , and i was going to be a lot of the , and , even though it wasn &apos;t really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful tape of <unk> .
and everybody who then <unk> , i went on .
at least for me , because if i do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring , i &apos;m very bored .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see myself .
are you nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not like , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s good , but only it doesn &apos;t <unk> , ok ?
if you have the <unk> too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what people are different race or ethnic ethnic race , but as citizens can all the same equal same .
in egypt , i was actually discovered by the end .
this was studied in london , in yemen and climbed into amsterdam an airplane to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the basis .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , well laden &apos;s family is one of the richest families of saudi <unk> .
what happened there was a political coalition that was <unk> for a political destination , and that was to remove the leaders .
these are the tools are usually interesting when they become more attractive .
it <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and then <unk> them .
and because of social networking , chinese students who were studying abroad , or companies from the rest of the world who had the offices to china , people were listening to the world that the news .
and finally , the chinese is through .
we are increasingly in a media environment in media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but everything in the first thing , i will still take a picture of what i was doing .
and then , in my fourth <unk> , a comet <unk> , a comet on the mountain .
this is the <unk> up , the first 600 feet of the rise of base camp .
and that &apos;s in camp four .
and there were climber on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck weathers , another climber , in this storm collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so tricky , there &apos;s so tricky , to work on the top , sometimes , i was actually injecting syringes right through clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can only <unk> how he did that .
and so it &apos;s going to turn back back into action .
these are sherpas who &apos;s light on the <unk> .
and the fourth thing that was very important for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the enterprise , entrepreneurs have become entrepreneurs to models , and they &apos;re going to have to be a great deal with society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy to do , because they were trying to bring the ideas from the universal world , parliament and the <unk> and so on .
the third thing is again again .
the second is the <unk> that we have , entrepreneurs are so difficult to create relative jobs in companies , that 93 percent of india &apos;s in the <unk> domain .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have a chance to try to solve a modern <unk> , so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> of the time when you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important to india and important for the world .
so the government decides to choose even choose .
although some people on the left , it &apos;s actually not like to hear the revolution of markets that the <unk> were the <unk> , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they fear the masses .
so this whole constructive distrust between the <unk> and those who are .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would be statistically , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron cameron put 20 million pounds into a &quot; social <unk> fund to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in the social change
i &apos;m working on . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even when i &apos;m with my friend , jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m a ted boy , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t find it , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means i &apos;ve just heard everything you &apos;ve just heard about , and just with my voice , just with my voice .
and to the end of this , with this one right , i can leave my sounds , <unk> , repeat .
our people had to try to find 5,000 different <unk> of the right .
don &apos;t hear the ones who say that , you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right side is a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue <unk> transducer .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
a lot of these these are <unk> of the <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
it can &apos;t stop the procedure at the time and immediately .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really made a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going in both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and as quickly as possible .
and their jokes , as the <unk> of a <unk> , really , really only within the aesthetics .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time in trial , and the merchants have decided that that would be a lot too expensive .
these are the two <unk> of <unk> in the logic of the <unk> .
and i want to thank you this point , <unk> <unk> , really , that you &apos;ve made this very <unk> presentation .
once , i started to a very remote <unk> , and i noticed that the <unk> i should meet , not <unk> .
i think this is one of the <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there &apos;s plenty of ancient <unk> across the world across the u.k. , if you &apos;re the , you &apos;re going to leave the , you &apos;re going to be there that the <unk> were there were going to be the <unk> .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that i &apos;m going to help these organisms , to make it very remarkable , and my part of protecting their <unk> longevity in the future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals use <unk> , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , the <unk> mexico in all 31 states .
what did they do it ?
what could terrorists do today is now using technology ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested for the u.s. <unk> in the u.s. , these days drones to be used to <unk> <unk> in the united states .
so , as we see here , we turn ourselves in close-up .
now , there &apos;s a mortality rate of mortality , if you get it , but it &apos;s hard .
it will so many people killed the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , like this this outside of <unk> juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear the people , as scared , a certain <unk> of the risk .
and sadly , in 1999 , in 1999 , when she was working with the u of the <unk> , with the goal of their culture and language , with two more colleagues of the <unk> and and tortured and tortured and prisoners and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of wonder as young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are trying to go simple categories , light categories , because we don &apos;t consider the way of the .
but the whole community , all different <unk> , also the <unk> and <unk> , would sit down and praying . &quot;
because the <unk> , when you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , they feed the world , it &apos;s enough to the sky . &quot;
but no one faces ?
okay , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make my wife a little joy .
why am i going to my wife , <unk> , that was a sanitary pad ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company makes it <unk> , and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my hands , &quot; why are you going to be like this kind of nasty cloth ? &quot;
now 110 countries can access it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was still there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> and forth .
it actually happened that the cells in my fingers and <unk> <unk> .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you &apos;ve been 18 years old .
the prospect of that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years ago .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which is going to be absorbed and nurtured .
now , this may be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace it all with conventional , renewable resources -- but i think that &apos;s more about this .
and very special material that make abalone itself , millions of abalone abalone , all the time , every year .
and the idea was basically , i was basically , i &apos;m the paintbrush in my hand &apos;s hand , who come and i would interview .
but i wanted to interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> george abbott , who was 97 years old , and i think , was full of life life -- i think that way you can define it .
we know the big <unk> of <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the point of thing is to make anybody ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my <unk> .
he said , &quot; but i understand this . i can understand this . &quot;
half of the body was compromised , the other ones .
this is a <unk> of kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice thing .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the paintings we made , but what we &apos;ve actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars in the <unk> <unk> , the the ministers of the presidents , the high public officials to the state .
you know , you know , it &apos;s a applause .
most of the great companies are now convinced that they have to use strict guidelines against bribery and so on .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you &apos;re expecting you to order to order to order to order to order to order to do it ?
and this was the first time i thought that the expression on her face is actually reflect what it thinks of him .
well , he divides his life .
this french painter in the 18th century was known for his still life , but i was also , and also humans .
unfortunately , these <unk> are now their most of the time with a series of other orphans in archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a dinner dinner , and her parents gave us to honor .
&quot; congratulations you to come mad , james .
my father riots most of the time of his <unk> in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our films are stories that people can identify with .
so it can really be a young man out there , and it &apos;s got to think about certain negative things and think of this , or any kind of behavior behavior .
so , doug <unk> : so little time , so little time .
i think this is really the subject of this session .
so , you &apos;ve been careful this as a <unk> industry in the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a <unk> .
now art art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
it was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re totally <unk> .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , because you &apos;re shooting walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then the most important behavior .
and on the way , i had to leave a few bridges behind me .
everything refers to the <unk> and students who were the first meeting to say that there is a place to deny them .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- and little boxes and gnarly things i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me to be a involvement .
and one day i had one -- oh , vice versa .
i have the <unk> and the copper , very thin , so it <unk> .
and this is my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was like my house as a <unk> <unk> .
it was never completed .
the dome was a wish of the <unk> .
it was a attempt to turn this little piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 feet -- into a property , and you &apos;re separated these areas and the place and the dining room in this pavilion that <unk> <unk> , with a high space .
they call the &quot; plan <unk> . &quot;
here it is .
from the buildings in the field , it appears to be iceberg in the mountains .
our students , i don &apos;t want to galleries , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he said that this was the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re working on the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we not make cleaner burning <unk> ?
and one of the things that they found was they didn &apos;t <unk> .
and this is our <unk> briquettes .
and he has to be the health of the health impacts of wood and coal than compared to coal .
it &apos;s a place where this is india , if this is a india , in this room , just three of us in this room .
so you can &apos;t use these same concepts as in the united states to move things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after surgery , everything surgery .
now , this is not surprising . but we also asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business with our outer and our work with a universal phenomenon ?
so i want to tell a little bit about surgery that we &apos;re doing , and where we want to do .
we can replace the basis of the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with replace <unk> .
my topic is food in schools , because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next is <unk> .
people talk about sustainability , but we should be able to figure out what this is .
you know that everybody think they would have to be more and more food ?
and then they have <unk> , hey , we can sell the stuff to kids .
and this is a typical <unk> <unk> .
the things that we might do at home , and so important , we have to teach kids in schools .
we need to raise the staff .
this eight billion , by the way , two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money makes the government for a lunch .
when a little girl , my grandfather was sitting in a hot <unk> with me outside the sun .
when i go to a party , and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; will be matt .
i want to make their <unk> , to know everything about your <unk> creature -- that they even have a professional in your own own .
don &apos;t make it up the suspense . i want to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a documentary of <unk> about consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to see all the details of the most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that what they did ?
do you see ? who doesn &apos;t see it ? it &apos;s going to help .
we &apos;re starting to get <unk> . some examples .
now , jeff hawkins has described his efforts , a good theory of a big theory in neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what my &quot; is : &quot; who &apos;s in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is in charge . &quot;
now , in stockholm , in stockholm , in the stockholm , in 2006 , and the first picture , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street at the top of january .
so we did this enormous survey with many <unk> , trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years of <unk> -- from east europe , by east asia -- through the mountains of the <unk> , east north africa , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s the taliban who are going to be <unk> to the doors to the people who are sending their daughters to schools like to <unk> their daughters in the <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was <unk> , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what .
what &apos;s amazing that ?
so i &apos;d like to talk about some other patients about some other patients that are doing the difference in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that me the page of google earth , where we can fly at any address .
we are , they &apos;re most most underutilized resource in health care .
<unk> of seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take your environment with the sound waves . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the u.s. , the annual cost of equal 22 billion dollars in the u.s. , so bats can get us in every case .
so why should we do with age age ?
and if you go out there and you go out and look at this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be the economic development .
the booms of materials pumps pumps that doesn &apos;t all all the , but many countries the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why are it called &quot; <unk> &quot; ? &quot;
and so the countries in the bottom billion a very <unk> politics .
a few economists came just in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to be a auction ? it &apos;s going to unveil the value . &quot;
at this moment , in the world , a billion people in the world or <unk> countries , how can we help them ? the economist paul asks previews what we ask paul collier is a bold , compassionate plan that we can connect with the gap between arm and rich .
we have no container that they &apos;re made .
here he shares a <unk> surgeons in africa , which is necessary for the <unk> surgeries that are necessary .
so what we did is , imagine , imagine , and they could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of the most successful surgery .
so 14 years ago , i came to the first time that ordinary material , <unk> , that has been used for centuries for centuries .
he says , if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so we experimented with small <unk> <unk> to generate a <unk> of the fog , and it turns out , and it turns out that it can be shaped by people that can interact with it and move through , without being <unk> .
they were in their <unk> in the grass , who was the abrupt pattern of the <unk> to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
and so , i realized that this is a tremendous risk for our society .
when peter is moving his arm , this yellow dot is going to see the same location of activity , which is in <unk> mind .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these kinds of changes can be beyond death , even a claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me be careful what i don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t say science that will be a space , or that we will be scientific answers to any <unk> moral question .
now , why would this an objective morality isn &apos;t <unk> ?
how high is the chance that this is a top of human development ?
on the left , you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world of technologies of technologies and these technologies don &apos;t get <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to break down than they put together .
but then we have to talk again about well-being in a bigger context .
and what is its natural enemy , what the means the the the the the <unk> &apos;s the good measure of the the the <unk> .
it &apos;s a parasite , not a <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> , two millimeters long , slim , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we get these good <unk> for example in a <unk> , , they go to the flowers .
in israel , in israel , where we use over 1,000 hectares -- this is <unk> <unk> -- that &apos;s the equivalent of 10,000 israeli <unk> -- biological <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides were saving .
thirdly , to increase the awareness of the farmers of the potential of this <unk> .
<unk> is one of my favorite . .
it &apos;s still fun about the <unk> of making fun of the time , and i do it .
urban <unk> -- that &apos;s what the new york needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that -- i wasn &apos;t enough enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union , only a few decades , maybe within a decade after time , when the soviet union was most powerful .
because there are 80 percent there , the ones really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
so why do we actually do these balls in soup , but it &apos;s already in the time already ?
it &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
and we &apos;re going to decide to do for this , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a little bit of the cost of wherever , but it will be a lot of proportion to it .
and you may think , well they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even when canadians do the system , they do it as a way that society is .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back , some other gadgets , <unk> and scales to make some computations . okay ?
right . so this is the device .
there &apos;s a quality of paper and precision that just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s only being used to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors , because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s a meter of 80 size , you can <unk> over obstacles over <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel with one single axis is interconnected and so quickly turn on the same fast .
welcome to the <unk> , the robot , <unk> tech tech tech . &quot;
but the cool thing is the <unk> thing about it .
let &apos;s see how he makes . this was our first attempt , and ... <unk> !
but what &apos;s the secret of our success ?
but only from a spark of imagination is not enough .
this is a very important thing .
<unk> , who are being <unk> .
there is basically no a pool of good qualified teachers , and only eight percent of the people have a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a total empty of creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is it all <unk> team on the wheels , then the team won .
for the last few decades , but a lot of money , that was a way for shop shop , totally gone .
and after leaving , and the neighbors about what to eat and come from where and why , is a homework .
in this , it &apos;s literally impossible to create large barren areas .
i want you to invite you to follow my journey of the design and explore .
after four months &apos; <unk> , and now , he &apos;s come and now , eight months long long long .
so here &apos;s a few results .
this global act leads to climate change , how to do , even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , and i was very , very , for for personal reasons , for the reason for the reason .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was partly by the israeli mcdonald &apos;s <unk> is <unk> .
after treatment , we &apos;re going to make the child a a series of simple <unk> , to see how his vision fit .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we pursue these <unk> , and hopefully we have to cover more results .
and then , i &apos;ve got this <unk> for physical disabilities from <unk> , and i thought , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but before i accuse it , i &apos;m going to look at how this is like this .
but this was in the fall of &apos; 95 , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s got aimee to the <unk> in 1996 , and she &apos;s excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to anyone who i could , <unk> against the track , so i am talking to whom am i am here ?
i always had all won , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . take them off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and designers are going to be two <unk> 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they got someone who came through and the shoes .
it &apos;s almost impossible to look at the real losses of the economy , it &apos;s because we &apos;re using copyright math .
or to the 75,000 75,000 jobs .
and even something about mathematics : mathematics looks like mathematics -- like math -- and sometimes they don &apos;t -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in education , we spend about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of hand .
so when people ask me , is true ?
but the automation of the automation of the car allow it to separate these things , this is something else to do a car and learn how to be about the <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both the same time here .
and one of the reasons why is so important -- so it &apos;s very important to the test of the exams .
it was in the winter of 2009 , and i was blind for about a year .
i was particularly thinking about my father , who died , because of complications of a surgical surgery .
similarly , as you , just through the grasp of the <unk> , changing heat soil soil , and at time , a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was <unk> , and i was walking along broadway , i was blessed to the corner .
if you design a city in the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you &apos;re every <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous <unk> i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , be fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money for a good purpose and it creates emotional confidence .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and from heaven .
and so , this is the key to me , to remember that , that &apos;s not going to be <unk> here , and i didn &apos;t go up on the <unk> .
that was a very inspiring for me .
so if we want to make this book , we need to make any meaning of any meaning , we really need to be about it and <unk> with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
so , the academics who were doing this work , so we thought this was too <unk> , so we developed <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a <unk> of a laser laser .
alex worked on a little , something obscure , independent <unk> with the name for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that should be used in the film .
we have this <unk> operation through because we like yellow and <unk> to green <unk> .
let &apos;s take this apart , i &apos;m going to bring it into <unk> .
we , as humans , are the ones that we do , and we should make sure that our machines help us and build on it .
john , &quot; thank you very <unk> to reality .
what okolloh did would be possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the facilities that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to change this agreement .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and how all the good news is , you make a jump away from 20 years ago when the interest in the audience .
you &apos;re not always available for five days , so we got to change , and we started playing <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to play with the <unk> play .
the other was cricket cricket .
was this new india ? this was a different world where you could get the best , as long as you get the best player for the best price .
we all had to play games in calcutta , but we had never seen this , <unk> khan brought the audience with a <unk> song for <unk> -- to calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that day would come ?
hopefully , i &apos;ve been able to have a experience of getting richer and the game of the game , and hopefully , i think there &apos;s a long time to work in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is because they &apos;re <unk> in your memory , how often you have dogs and pigs on a rope .
why about everything in the world should be playing ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks , but it doesn &apos;t matter any of them , but people don &apos;t think that way .
well , in the big , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
watch what happens when we skip <unk> .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more listening to you , so they say , that our answer is , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no weapons of <unk> .
and so some people look at economists as dumb people .
and the theme is a one of these <unk> that requires certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with the subject that you &apos;re in .
and &quot; in words , in words , in a way , in fashion , there &apos;s the same rule as well as to be very fantastic , and too old , not the first one of the new jury was yet the last one that has taken the old one of the old . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe this isn &apos;t this ? &quot;
one -- my willingness to find me a critical audience , without i am sure i am sure i am .
it &apos;s my intention of being <unk> , you should not be understood it .
so in the big and all of that they &apos;re doing our survival .
jewish often , a uncomfortable smell of smell .
if the room <unk> , we could see that people more negative attitudes to the men are <unk> .
it &apos;s like i was <unk> to talk about what i did in this 20 years .
it feeds my spirit and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need a problem with the idiots .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of kids that had to have as much psychological trauma or or to africa .
through the whole book , they take more than an hour of <unk> and interactive animations .
so what &apos;s the business ?
it had at least that you , whatever , was still true to be true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they still talk about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern southern california , and you <unk> at the spanish <unk> on the roofs and stuff like that .
rsw : what &apos;s going on schedule ?
the <unk> -- they sent me for mit , and they sent me to the original <unk> to bilbao .
that &apos;s reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you want to leave for four months , the ideas will always more and more and live .
and one thing i wanted to mention my <unk> , but somehow , i &apos;ve missed , it was to thank all the companies that helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are going to get momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things are remarkable , and this is what i &apos;m supposed to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible effort to 15,000 workers , i think five of domes and the sixth is built here .
at this level , to work around 1,500 workers .
fifty percent of the computer in the world are going to go to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan stefan , that less than five percent of the commercials had a picture of the subject .
and wish is : <unk> . i &apos;ve been told myself , and i wanted to go to this kind of thing .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we find out how we can win these materials from these very extreme complex <unk> .
the traditional ways of separate material , just don &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way to make <unk> is going on oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
we may be like to study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they commit the same <unk> .
here &apos;s mayday . it will trade a tokens for food and waits happy , and you get food .
they &apos;re waiting for a little impatient that the market opens up .
now , imagine that i &apos;m given any thousand <unk> dollars in the hand -- 10 hundred <unk> of notes .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- like , i throw a coin . you &apos;re really going to get a lot of losing .
if we made these same scenarios , they would have the same things about people to do ?
the person on the left is a safe loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development that make dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about wood buildings , they &apos;re just four stories tall .
we need to be less with concrete and steel and we have to build up , we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
this is just as much as we did in a year , 900 cars on the streets .
<unk> curtains <unk> my windows .
perhaps , even &quot; citizen , &quot; because recently they got up to fight against the decline of justice , the citizens of these networks are working together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , mostly in the native government , is now to crowdsource to bring employees and citizens into the development of innovation .
we heard about the ted talk about people who have been hacked with -- and <unk> , to help the world young people , to create websites and turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother &apos;s always asks , &quot; are all the children there ? &quot;
this is empathy .
he asked them to convey a message , and everybody read in their own language , a central <unk> <unk> , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do you , the <unk> doesn &apos;t do any other . &quot;
a pastor is to be a pastor , to take these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this by some <unk> .
there &apos;s about 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints in his illumination .
the bladder is a <unk> .
i watched my aunt being raped , when i was only five .
one of the things i witnessed when i was trying to eat my friend because we had no food , and we were about 400 .
as a child , as a child , <unk> words that i can &apos;t forget .
this is my story , shared a sense of a lesson .
my breakfast , i lunch , i i get a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes .
the third chapter is a more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent .
we &apos;re going to solve this task , by the death of death .
and even if it happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
so the santa would know whether you were <unk> or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you &apos;ve been so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiling , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they said , &quot; believe we all brothers and nurses on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger capacity to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the harshest of the harshest of the world , &quot; the road &quot;
in second world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it needs to be a basic contributions , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but then the good news .
it may be in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptic and <unk> of climate change in the world .
we did a project a few years ago , a project for the <unk> project , a big program , which meant -- with many , many , many of people -- a lot of people -- all the evidence that supports this -- a <unk> <unk> .
a group of hire them to spend on themselves and the other group is to spend it for other people .
when they went to the second building , all of the man , all of the crooked crooked and <unk> , and the <unk> help . the question is : did they were to and helped ?
the word is &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &quot; -- this stuff : the hidden life of the things .
since since since , it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been practicing with the best in this field , the <unk> , the same , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a rich web of art , successes and accolades .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my power , my my energy life life .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and urged him to adapt to my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
it &apos;s like it was .
he put them together , put them into something <unk> , and then he converted them into this software , which i think she had had his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
these documents there are little <unk> , small boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , you make a beautiful website , and how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
now , what you &apos;re asking is the linked data , which you &apos;re put together in the meantime . 32 hits , which is each one of a protein with these characteristics and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what it goes linked data .
all this will lead to that every year every year , two million children die less than in the year 2000 .
and if it &apos;s like , we &apos;re willing to collect feedback , and to make sure that the promise of the patent can actually deliver results ?
you just show you a numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw tips for drawing and painting .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow about the street , from bangalore after bangalore ?
it &apos;s only as people to be trained as people to perceive the reality . and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; well , okay .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re an artist ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because , if we see someone by a walk , we see the footprint .
what percentage of these have foreign <unk> were turned to the ?
obviously , he sat the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually designed to get to end up here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;m talking about economists <unk> assumption that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to get something technical now .
think of the toyota .
you can &apos;t be about it , so they accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very difficult to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza will get you when you have hungry .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so , remember , when we think about sexuality education and activities , they &apos;re out of the baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen , and it goes like , &quot; i can &apos;t bear the <unk> .
and that &apos;s like , &quot; how much percent of the day you do is you think about this person ? &quot;
in about 175 societies , people have left <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why think they &apos;re more than women ? &quot;
no one of the time on this was the women were so educated , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 , she was taken her for them .
i started to <unk> , why you were more like in love with one person than the other .
they &apos;re going to be long as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called &quot; this <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it may be that the resistance of gain and age-related diseases -- at least in most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much more <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our views about diabetes are wrong ?
my great great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , to improve the lives of people to improve and make cars for everyone .
and the good news is that we &apos;re now going to go to the big problems of cars and environment -- not only at ford , but overall as industry .
i think you can imagine it .
but what excites me is the possibility that we &apos;re going to have to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that &apos;s able to support these flexibility to the future .
this is a minute .
i think now my mother is so kind of <unk> .
the nurses have to go into data .
it &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s this in this process ?
it also , for us , because we won a lot of awards .

after a few <unk> , i thought , but i finally , this is the <unk> .
add . so you can .
okay . the <unk> is used by thousands of people worldwide .
or we could use one of these these here .
mao tse <unk> described it as the european civil wars , and that &apos;s probably a more accurate description .
my view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not going to be the more of the other possible .
they start to see the <unk> of a <unk> world .
but this is not the case .
the <unk> of nations , now we &apos;ve always had .
but now one last thing .
but if you ask today the question of the question , what the optimal formula for a long life is , you may probably be able to tell you this .
it reminds me my college time .
and the research shows that this is the same part of chronic diseases , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re at half .
and for a while we looked at the <unk> <unk> , where there are actually a high proportion to <unk> .
instead , they &apos;re talking about the next trip in nature , trade recipes , and yes , they pray .
it &apos;s us to be the <unk> .
they tend to feed their own .
for the little example that i think in hand here in hand , we &apos;ve used a <unk> <unk> that responds to my skin , by this little light light .
they were so often amateurs , no experts , the inventors and <unk> of things like mountain <unk> , <unk> , pc computers , aircraft .
at the time , computers had a very large figures that only scientists were interested , and no one of them dreamed of them at home .
you just have the eyes to come through there .
i mean , i mean , he was already seen .
and we looked at the driver , we looked at the driver .
and i said , i can &apos;t get it , but i can put it into zero-g , to zero-g gs .
we had four <unk> and two nurses on the plane .
and actually , you can now show you some images , because i &apos;m not going to see on the screen .
no life , the smallest life of the smallest of us all over here , without these little threads .
i &apos;m <unk> . i went to eat .
i didn &apos;t change me . my iq was not decreased .
i was a writer .
so basically , no one would have to family family family if their child didn &apos;t survive .
and then we decided to be , why not the religion , because in the philippines , the catholic church was quite strong , and <unk> are buddhist .
so we first approached our first <unk> , and the women who organized it , &quot; we want to do family family planning .
you can call it the coca-cola of a bit of a bit , if you like , it &apos;s the same thing .
and then aids education education education started in the university started in university .
and then there is , the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go home without home . &quot;
these are things that are put together by the business .
can you imagine , in any starbucks , you can also get condoms ?
it may not be scary or scary .
so i &apos;m going to do a picture .
you can simulate this behavior in the browser , which is what &apos;s the time , you can just do on the left .
i want to tell you my four minutes of the story .
people like all here in this room .
they went elegant , like a giraffe in the african savannah , the flag on their shoulder , and i <unk> afterwards -- -- on the <unk> , the flag with <unk> arm , so my head dropped off the fuckin thing .
i &apos;ve worked with women and for women .
jenny is clear that the only thing is to pull the bad teeth .
it brings the women to plant new trees and to <unk> , drop a drop of them .
women and children , especially the poor , are down at the bottom .
if you sell too early , you get the win , but if you &apos;re going too long to you get to pay for a long , you fall away from the course .
you can see the peaks , but clear .
the challenge for the most challenging player is whether he thinks the other is fair or that it thinks that only one or two dollars for free .
now , i &apos;m going to share with you a few of relatives .
we can try it . maybe we &apos;ll be .
so what are we learned today ?
about 10 calories , to make a food food that we consume in the west .
how do you have a city like that ?
and then , in the middle east , in <unk> , they &apos;re offering for sale . that &apos;s why it &apos;s called <unk> .
and at that point , our relationship is completely , and to the cities as well as the cities .
the word nature uses thomas moore .
<unk> piles of the <unk> .
we have to understand that the world is also what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of all morality , this <unk> act of <unk> , to put on one another .
and i see that a drum doesn &apos;t just want a <unk> sensation .
in the present , we have <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> -- and a half years &#91; &#93; &#93; a million pieces , a million pieces , pretty complex , new and exciting technologies made of steel , concrete , glass .
the next project is the question and look at the passive nature , or the consumer , to make <unk> <unk> .
basically , you have a chain of elements .
when i was in <unk> , wisconsin , i was given a public talk in front of a group of school school .
often , we &apos;re looking at <unk> by the absence of flu like , for example .
there are unknown everywhere around us , and it just waiting for us are being discovered .
so could we turn the light off now , so we can see it ?
so we &apos;re chemical <unk> , which is different . our kind of chemical <unk> of thermodynamics .
but there i have to confess -- and i &apos;m going to tears , richard -- that i &apos;ve never liked biological <unk> , and i think we &apos;re going to be a few hundred million years ago .
everybody &apos;s talking about things , one prevention of the <unk> to enforce every price .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to make various laws that enable young resources to win the economy to win the other customer .
they &apos;re both dark in comparison with puerto rico , which has half as many people as haiti or the dominican republic .
to one of these zones besides the <unk> of hong kong is covered shenzhen .
people can come to live under the charter , but no one is forced to live .
so much of those have the idea of the <unk> is that people can participate in rules .
how would we write a deal with this ?
you thought , genomics , a little bit more than 10 years ago , that you &apos;ve sequenced this year between three and five genomes , it &apos;s already hundreds of them .
if there &apos;s lots of chlorophyll , they &apos;re very much green light .
the number of common genes expanded a little bit , if we ignored a <unk> parasite ignored ; it &apos;s got more larger if we focused on certain <unk> of genes , on about <unk> .
it adds up with a radiation after a radiation , through the chromosomes into little chunks , within 12 to 24 hours .
so let me end with ethical and political research .
of course , it &apos;s worth the wait when you like <unk> .
we call them &quot; <unk> . &quot; they focus on what &apos;s going to be .
and it also also , as a poor child was a <unk> child in the south bronx , everybody lived in the past and the present .
let &apos;s take the area of medicine .
this is a beautiful picture of the <unk> , the largest <unk> of the <unk> in the way of our milky way galaxy .
it &apos;s cold , <unk> and <unk> , may be raining and maybe they &apos;re the bank of a <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how this was , the first images of the surface of the surface is to see the surface of the surface , this is what we saw .
so here we see a film from the <unk> <unk> , which is this dunes , this dunes are 100 meters tall , a distance from a few kilometers and and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so far , the earth is still the only planet , where we know that life is alive .
they had lost 40 percent of their country , and they would have been so they couldn &apos;t have free access to the rest of the west bank .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we organized a demo .
it took only four days .
and as the rest of the brain is it &apos;s in neurons .
in the hippocampus of the hippocampus , you find cells that are in the hippocampus , the exact way in the hippocampus , or the edges or the rat or to the rat or to the mouse , if you study the environment .
and this would be represented by the fire fire .
he was not the only man who was at a school who had no <unk> , and he was certainly not the only great speaker .
and why should anybody care about this ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and analytical thoughts and <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so we look at it .
and when you talk about it , you will attract the people who believe what they believe .
the reason for that , people were an iphone in the first six hours , the first six hours , their worldview was their worldview , and their will you see it , and you were the first one . they were the first .
people don &apos;t buy what they do , they buy why they do , and what they &apos;re doing is just as evidence for what they believe .
and , by the way , he said , &quot; i have a dream , &quot; i don &apos;t like that &quot; i have a plan . &quot;
i will never forget , &quot; cartoons in <unk> over the screens of <unk> .
when this was the office in washington , d.c. , the <unk> clinic , they were <unk> .
and we decided to use recipes to this purpose .
what if we had a waiting room , you don &apos;t just get <unk> when you &apos;re sick , but you &apos;re going to get healthy , you know , to be healthy .
and they &apos;re leaving this with the belief , the ability and the effectiveness , our basic aspiration in health care doing it .
i think that ultimately , when we grade our health care , it &apos;s not about the sick that were being fixed , but to the diseases that were not going to be .
it &apos;s a real threat to the whole world today , but this is in the indian ocean .
we &apos;ve been struck with this <unk> . there were six tons of cocaine .
eighty-five percent of you can &apos;t read when they enter into the afghan <unk> .
multiply the <unk> of these public cooperation with <unk> , how safety of the world can be completely different .
i really do .
remember , remember , this is a fun of me when the <unk> were , you know , you &apos;re counting the dots for the gore , you count the points for bush . count again .
the circles represent the countries .
some countries have been statistics .
but we need to get the united states a whole piece of the to the same health , which is now in the philippines .
it &apos;s starting to start .
it looks like a happy story .
what they &apos;re doing here -- on what &apos;s going to live in the ground -- is your daily charge .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing developing world , which is us , argentina and mozambique 50 years ago , and said that mozambique has been worse .
governance , governance . a working government -- that led california from the <unk> of australia .
and i &apos;ve shown the idea of how the seemingly impossible possible .
and the enemy is pretty weak .
we are -- despite skepticism -- with ease in afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not a ideal world . &quot; and it doesn &apos;t turn us a step closer . &quot;
what would like a <unk> rules look like ?
what we need to do is a <unk> <unk> .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor &apos;s doctor says , he just shouldn &apos;t move .
&quot; who &apos;s us , risk the end of the world . &quot;
it &apos;s only going to be <unk> from his pen .
it &apos;s <unk> .
air , strategic <unk> <unk> .
thomas <unk> : a new way to peace on peace
i don &apos;t want to <unk> them too much .
this is the <unk> in the early <unk> , which had a lot of sulfur in the stratosphere , with a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
this report ended up on president <unk> desk when i was two years old .
but let &apos;s say they have sunlight that hits the particles , and it &apos;s <unk> .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely to be .
so since we &apos;re going to continue to the climate scale and further from climate change .
not just how we do it better , but what are the risks and effects effects ?
here you see a fish with shining , <unk> eyes .
really incredible . there are two males fighting two males .
and so i came to her kind of personal invitation , just two days from the himalayas .
but if you look at the literature in east and west , you &apos;re going to be incredibly different definitions of happiness .
well-being is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state of actually <unk> and all of them and all occupational and sorrow and worry about the <unk> .
and we know from experience we can be in something that you &apos;re known as &quot; a &quot; little paradise , and inside of it can be completely unhappy .
the mirror allows it to be , but the mirror doesn &apos;t be tainted by these images .
if you do it again , your tendency to keep the anger and again , let &apos;s stay on it , lower it , lower .

we &apos;re ready to have 15 years for our education .
it &apos;s really a <unk> for us .
it &apos;s a <unk> place . it &apos;s good .
you can see exactly what &apos;s happening at night to the <unk> .

this is actually a television television , the <unk> show , &quot; we &apos;re normal .
we &apos;re going to -- we have a <unk> , which would be ashamed of drums .
one last comment -- i think i &apos;ve been concerned for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
at this point , we &apos;re about two days from the entrance entrance .
this is <unk> <unk> cycle .
the ice can be deep between five and 25 miles .
the <unk> of the <unk> look at the back and back in the back , so that it can do new <unk> , while it keeps still in the eye , which it has already been .
it would pay 10,000 dollars in orbit .
it says that you &apos;re going to move 10,000 feet a second , when you &apos;re trying to get back to the gas station .
the right support , it can be done in seven years .
i suppose you won &apos;t throw me from the places , because they asked the question .
so they also formed a few companies where the brand doesn &apos;t work so well .
rb : no .
we have a video that shows you what you &apos;re planning , and virgin <unk> <unk> in the air .
did he wanted them jump , or he just said , &quot; i am going to go ? &quot;
