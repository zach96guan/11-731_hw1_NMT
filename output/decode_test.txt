you know , one of the great <unk> of travel , and one of the pleasures at the research research is to live with the people who still remember the old days , and the still the wind still , you can feel the the the the the the time , they touch the bitter leaves of plants .
just knowing that <unk> still is still beyond the way , or the importance of myths in the world of the world &apos;s the world &apos;s the <unk> , or that in the himalayas the the <unk> still be more true , but that in the himalayas the the <unk> still , is the the breath of the <unk> , but it &apos;s the idea that we have , and it &apos;s a a a a a a a a <unk> of a <unk> .
and of course , we share the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we &apos;re going through .
we have to be given us with the <unk> <unk> through death , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise us all singing , dance and and art .
but interesting is the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of the <unk> in any culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s to the <unk> of the woods of borneo , or the <unk> <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the middle of the world , or a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other other , other ways of thinking , other ways to be an orientation on earth .
and this is a notion that , if you think about it , you can only meet with hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are a web of <unk> and <unk> life that are the earth &apos;s and for the sake of the earth as well as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and it can imagine as the <unk> of all thought and dreams , wild ideas , inspiration and intuitions , the of the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are as amazing as an amazing species .
and as as the biosphere has been strong , this was the <unk> -- just with even more speed .
no biologist would be a biologist , for example , 50 percent or more of all species are just before , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> of the biodiversity -- is almost the way we <unk> as a <unk> <unk> on the entire cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
and as any of you , in this room , were born to 6,000 languages .
now a language is not just the sum of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is access to the tangible world .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a tipping point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting in monterey , the same one of the other than the ears are <unk> .
they &apos;re not taught the <unk> , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely , as being the silent <unk> , one of the last of your people who speak your language , no possibility to allow the wisdom of the ancestors to be able to pass , or to hope to hope ?
and yet , what happens happens to be that terrible of the story in the earth , about about the two weeks , because of the two weeks , an older man , and the last <unk> of an old language .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world a better place , if we all talk about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see , what if they &apos;re all of their own language , if you could not speak your own language .
and so i &apos;d like to take you a way of a journey in a journey , a little bit of a brief journey through the <unk> , to try to understand how to understand what was actually lost .
now there are some of us , that &apos;s sort of forget that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his own , &quot; really different ways of his .
take for example , this child in the northwest part of the amazonas , the people of the <unk> , believing that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest that people depend on , <unk> .
they have a strange language and a <unk> that is called the genius of <unk> : you must marry someone who &apos;s a different language .
all this comes in the <unk> past , and this is <unk> to these big houses where they talked about six or seven languages , but that you never hear someone who &apos;s learning a language .
they just stop and start talking to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first year , 1958 , 1958 .
in 1957 1957 , 1957 , five <unk> can get to <unk> and made a <unk> mistake .
they threw colored photographs from the air , which we &apos;d been grading as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people in their lives had never seen anything in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest , trying to see the face or the character , and there was nothing and <unk> that this was called the business of cancer and killing five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> doesn &apos;t kill the <unk> , just outside the spear .
they &apos;re <unk> .
54 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we monitored the eight eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we were doing the people with a twist to a <unk> , they gave them that one of the people that were so old , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear clear of the forest that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps to smell and determine what the animal species was .
in the early age , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me whether i was interested in haiti and the secret societies that were the foundation of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the poison that were used to make a <unk> .
to make sense of this <unk> , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the knowledge and <unk> <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world world , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is always left out because the presumption was that it &apos;s not going to believe in africa , of course , there was one and <unk> , and it &apos;s just the little of these very profound religious thought that &apos;s the tragic diaspora of the <unk> <unk> .
but what &apos;s interesting interesting is this is the living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living is the spirit of the people .
the minds can be <unk> from the big water , answers to the rhythm of the <unk> , to be the soul of the living in the living , so that the <unk> is for a brief <unk> moment for a very <unk> moment .
<unk> says the <unk> , like , &quot; your white goes to church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple , and will god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , how can you do it ?
and you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , the coal coal coal without combustion <unk> , an amazing graph of the mind of the mind to the body so to govern that this is <unk> when it is in a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all of all people i met , the <unk> of the sierra nevada in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> , the most extraordinary .
the offspring of the ancient civilization , the caribbean of the caribbean in northern colombia and in the aftermath of the wake , the people moved into a <unk> <unk> mass that &apos;s about the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that have never been bitten by the <unk> .
until the day , it will be driven by a ritual priesthood , and the training to priesthood is a very extraordinary thing to the priesthood .
the young <unk> , at age three and four years from their families separated , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of the glaciers for 18 years , <unk> , for the <unk> of the <unk> , two periods of nine years , to be able to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , to the <unk> of their mother &apos;s lap , and they &apos;re now going to be able to mimic the <unk> of their mother &apos;s lap , and they &apos;re now going to be the <unk> in the
and during this time , they &apos;re going to be culturally the values of their society , values that sustain their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- equilibrium .
and at the end of this amazing , <unk> , she &apos;s going to be taken out of the time , and the first time in her life , at age 18 years , you see a <unk> , and in this <unk> moment of the , and the sun begins to the <unk> of the first light , and the sun begins to the <unk> of the amazing light , all of all of all of all of all the , when the sun begins to cover the sun &apos;s the sun begins to the the sun &apos;s
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we &apos;re going to <unk> the old mathematical bombsight , which is a <unk> of the fancy <unk> wild that &apos;s in his simplification , a <unk> thought or to the other quote , and say , these people are more related to nature than we .
so , native is neither <unk> , are not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to be compromised by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold <unk> of tibet , but still still , through time and ritual that has a mysterious <unk> of the earth , which is not in the idea that the earth is just in the idea because it &apos;s in the human mind .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child comes from the andean <unk> , which is a <unk> or your fate , will be a different person , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to this resource , and a little <unk> relationship to this resource , or this place , as a little kid , and a little <unk> of this is a little <unk> in the belief that a little kid in montana , which is where a little kid in montana , which is where a little kid in montana , which
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor that the relationship between the individual and nature nature . nature .
i grew up in the woods of <unk> colombia , and believed that these are the forest to be <unk> .
that made me to another people as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forest the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> spirit that are the <unk> of the world , the <unk> of the world , who are living in their <unk> .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can integrate different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this this plant .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last last april in the northwest part of the amazon .
this is <unk> , many of you &apos;ve heard about , the most powerful discouraging is the repertoire of the <unk> .
what makes the most interesting thing that is fascinating is not just the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> -- it &apos;s actually made from two different sources . one side , there &apos;s made these wooden <unk> , and one side , it &apos;s like this wooden <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that serotonin and <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like this stuff , this substance that they contain from different ways that they contain from different ways .
this powder was too much like from a <unk> <unk> , <unk> paintings and the landing on the sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t become distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who was the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of magical mushrooms in mexico in mexico , and i said that this <unk> doesn &apos;t be a <unk> , because in the moment , you &apos;re not there to experience a <unk> .
but the thing about <unk> is that they can &apos;t be taken up , because you through a human gut of course , the human gut of course , is called <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be taken by connecting with some other chemicals that the mao <unk> .
now the amazing thing is that the <unk> that contain the <unk> , are the <unk> of the kind of thing that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> , so they &apos;re asking themselves .
how can these people from a <unk> of 80,000 species , these two <unk> are not the two crops to the plants that are combined , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which was meaningless .
but the native americans say , &quot; the the box is to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> that they all at a lot of distance in the forest that seem like a kind of like .
and then you ask them , you know , they &apos;re both and they say , &quot; i thought you understand this .
i mean , you know , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take each of the 17 different varieties of <unk> and they sing into one different <unk> .
now , this doesn &apos;t get you a doctor at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting to count .
now , the <unk> of the problem is that even those of us who are <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , they look at the <unk> and <unk> , but they kind of look at the past , but the real world , that means the world &apos;s real world .
so , in fact , in the 20th century , in 300 years , not to remember the wars or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we &apos;ve been in the world and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on earth is not to supported and passive .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> stopped being less to sioux , when they <unk> and the arrow of americans , when americans stopped americans than they stopped the horse and <unk> tasks .
it &apos;s not change and technology is the natural <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re discovering that these cultures are not the extinction of the world , these are dynamic living peoples that are living by <unk> forces that are <unk> by their capacity , and now , and prostitution and prostitution at the <unk> , where the japanese <unk> are <unk> .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i work out there , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction of people is convicted of people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives , not only convicted of but not convicted , but in general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand that the suffering , if you have experienced it at the <unk> level .
i was traveling with a young colleagues , 6,000 miles from <unk> to lhasa , and only when i came to the statistics of the statistics that you hear , the the statistics of whom you hear , 6,000 , 1.2 monuments , who were being killed by rubble and ash .
the father of this young <unk> was identified as the <unk> was identified .
it meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle was assassinated with their holiness the diaspora to nepal .
his mother was incarcerated , as punishment for the crime for the crime .
he was smuggled in the age of two years in prison to hide under their <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister , the <unk> did , <unk> , was brought into a <unk> .
one day , she stepped up on a <unk> , and for those <unk> , she had to work for seven years to seven years .
the suffering <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of people is something <unk> .
and at the end , we really got a choice . we want to live in a <unk> world of the world &apos;s <unk> or in a world &apos;s world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said before she died , that it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move into a thread , <unk> , <unk> change , we &apos;re not only going to see the entire range of human imagination in a <unk> way , but that we have ever been able to have any other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species has existed for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and we in this moment of the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the <unk> of the priesthood of the priesthood and hierarchy and hierarchy and <unk> -- was only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know , is barely 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all the answers to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
so if we ask these myriad <unk> to the importance of human , respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be the possibility of being the ability to be , people with the skills that are the importance of all people and the way to make a space that have to be <unk> , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> , when i was with <unk> on the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit , and during the <unk> of the <unk> of our reign , they were forced to pull into settlements .
the grandfather refused to be .
the family , fear of his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit is not frightened of the cold , and they were using them to their advantage .
and then the <unk> of their <unk> were filled with fish that was wrapped up in <unk> .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s grandfather &apos;s not about the arctic night or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , his shorts and his pants gets down and <unk> his hand , and when the fecal fecal , <unk> , he shaped them into the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the side of the <unk> , and as it was totally frozen , he &apos;s <unk> a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog and he <unk> a dishes , he took a <unk> , and he throws a sledge , <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> on the <unk> of the shelter for the arena belt .
so you can do anything like this .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the resistance and all native rights in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in the <unk> of the <unk> , in 1999 , which is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new home , called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all <unk> .
an amazing example , like a nation , a nation that can go and to the people who are looking for their people .
and ultimately , i think , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are the far goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that has gone in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are the dreams of our own children &apos;s geography .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling storytelling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution to storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million <unk> every month .
156 nations send our <unk> .
our magazines are read from millions of millions .
and we &apos;re going to have a series of trips to the <unk> of the <unk> , where we &apos;re the audience to be these <unk> , and hopefully , you will be the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of anthropology , and then you will be able to find a <unk> in a truly vibrant world where the world has made it .
thank you .
what i &apos;m looking at you first as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve just a a a bit of a year ago , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s a environment that you can use it local or a giant amounts of visual data .
we see lots of books in the digital photographs here that you seamlessly seamlessly and continuously <unk> , <unk> , in the ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big are the images are .
most of you are digital photographs , but this is a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this is that i can , is the number of aircraft on your screen in every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not to a picture , we can actually do something like this , to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and a picture .
maybe this is a fake way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
and every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a a newspaper or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also made something about this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal ad and we added extra .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this is really the way that ideas to allow these limits in the place available to the place .
we hope that this is no longer and other nonsense , it &apos;s not necessary to be necessary .
of course , this is the one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be involved in this domain .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get some different out of it .
this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> , which is really two different technologies .
one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research of <unk> , which is a <unk> at the university of washington , with the council of steve <unk> at the <unk> of steve <unk> .
and rick <unk> from microsoft research was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by <unk> .
you can see that , if we create these kinds of views , where we can go through images and the experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial orientation is actually in the way that &apos;s doing .
the <unk> , these images , they put these in the real room , in which these footage that were made all the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> , and they &apos;re seeing here from <unk> slides slides slides and <unk> and these things that have been in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more nuanced .
i &apos;d like to go straight to one of the <unk> <unk> , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we first in summer to show you what i think is that it really is the punchline behind this technology , the <unk> is , and this is not necessarily as obvious , when you look at the environments we &apos;re on the same thing .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a <unk> dame dame who was put only in the computer with images . they just put the <unk> of the <unk> and and they &apos;re going to <unk> images from men in <unk> shirts and and on and on and forth . each of this orange , a picture that was discovered as a model of <unk> .
so this is all <unk> , and they all have in in the space in the same way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i was going to work with microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception reception .
and i guess you can see that these are lots of different types of cameras : everything that is to professional professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them that are all in these environment .
and if i can , i &apos;m going to find some of the kind of weird .
many of them are covered by their faces .
somewhere here are a series of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of dame lady that was right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is here that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collecting data from all -- from all of the collective memory of this , as visual earth looks like -- and everything is interconnected .
all these photographs are interconnected and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of doing stephen <unk> &apos;s earth .
and this is something that &apos;s through complexity , which is the people use it , and it &apos;s the use of the user to be larger .
their own photographs are going to have the <unk> that have a different person .
if someone did the effort , and all these saints and shares them who they are all , then my photograph of the dame of all of all of all of this data , and i can use them as a place to dive into this space , and i can use them as a place to dive into this room , and i can use them as a place to dive into this room , and i can use them as a place to dive into this room , and we use a kind of <unk> <unk> of
and of course , <unk> all of these are the vast rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that are not just through <unk> or satellite imaging , but they were so on collective memory .
thank you .
so , i understand it right ? your software is to allow you to a certain point in the next few years , all the images that can be used by someone in the world are essentially going to be linked to the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t matter any other than discover .
if they want to make them <unk> between the images .
and they do this because of the nature of the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the abundance of information information , which is a lot of these images .
like you do a <unk> of images , where they do sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is this .
but how about the image associated with all your pictures ?
then the amount of the <unk> <unk> and the abundance that makes it really , really , it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , i hope , in the other things you &apos;ve already heard . and i &apos;m going to try to make myself some connections , if you haven &apos;t been seen these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; dictionary &quot; &quot; dictionary . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all of the western developed societies .
the official <unk> works , when our goal is the maximize the public good good good , this is all through the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , value , sense , a <unk> premise for human rights .
when people have freedom , everybody &apos;s all of us , is to maximize the things that we have to choose our public public and no one has to decide for us .
and the way freedom to maximize is to maximize choice .
the more choices have the more freedom , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common .
this is , i think so deep in our water supply , that it would not be able to be able to question it .
and it &apos;s also ingrained in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you &apos;re not <unk> the 10 different <unk> , and 12 <unk> they could buy a large amount of their own high <unk> in the unlikely case that is not the <unk> in the store for it .
so that &apos;s like the supermarket is .
and then they go to the <unk> store , a stereo <unk> -- loudspeakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , finger , and in this electronics , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can have <unk> million different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of components that are offered in this one .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there you could have a <unk> , you wanted to have a telephone , you wanted to be angry , he was like <unk> bell .
they have their phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of it was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile mobile in the future .
my favorite is the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> <unk> .
and you should not have seen that until you haven &apos;t seen it in their business , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be soon .
and what it does it is bringing people to run into business and that question .
now you know what the answer is this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more <unk> than the <unk> that the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , instead going to go to the doctor , and the doctor says you could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b is these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and the risks and b has both the benefits and the risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &apos;s autonomy . &quot; sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of people who know about -- <unk> -- -- <unk> -- -- -- <unk> -- -- <unk> -- and it &apos;s not in the best health , and it &apos;s not in the best health .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like them and me , that if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we couldn &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor in the next morning and to ask a change .
something like our identity as a result of the choice of how this this slide is supposed to show this slide .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re often looking at as many as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , you have to decide what kind of person they want to be .
in terms of marriage , family , there was a time in the <unk> , that almost everybody had a , and they could <unk> them as fast as they could , and then kids got kids as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now , it &apos;s just too easy .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re very careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re engaged with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; i am i going to marry or not ? am i going to marry ?
should i marry you ? i should i have kids , or do it first career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all the <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether this means all the tasks i &apos;m going to give you to get them and not good grade grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to the questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl has this , with the technology that allows us to work every single day on the planet -- to work on the hotel hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way i &apos;m not telling anybody about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions and again and again , whether we should work or not work or not work .
we can play our kids in soccer , watching soccer , and we have our cell phone to the hip , and our blackberry to other hip hip , and our laptop probably on our laps .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to take our child in the <unk> of a <unk> , we &apos;re too , &quot; should i suppose this call ?
should i answer this email ? i should write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it will be your experience of the child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question .
and the world in the world we lived in .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all the choice was .
and the world in now is looking at life .
and the question is , is the good , bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we know all the things that is good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
it &apos;s a effect , <unk> ways , is that it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
with so many of options you can choose , it will be very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
one , a colleague of mine had access to <unk> <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she was found was a 10 <unk> of the employer , the involvement to two-thirds of the employer .
they provide 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees assume , when they were only five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> that are the choice , it &apos;s so difficult to decide what you want to choose for tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , and tomorrow comes never .
you know that this is not only means that people eat food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the way , it means that they &apos;re going to have enough to be the decisions that they &apos;re missing great <unk> .
and not to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the <unk> , the happy would have been to replicate their contributions .
it &apos;s a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s what it looks like this is the world .
they want the decision to make really right if it &apos;s all the time , right ?
they don &apos;t want the wrong investment fund , or even the fake <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less pleased with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to choose between less ways .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is to take a lot of different <unk> of different <unk> if you buy a buy , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , that &apos;s a perfect -- it &apos;s just perfect ? it &apos;s just to imagine that you could have been a different decision .
the more options , the easier , it &apos;s easier to regret at all , that &apos;s a little bit of the choices they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point in this morning , and he told how much the way we &apos;re doing is what we compare to .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to think , is it just to imagine features of alternatives that you agree with that , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that you chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not in new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks of the thought he &apos;s missing the opportunity , day , a great lot day .
<unk> <unk> , the satisfaction that we get through our choices , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more ways you have to give you the choices , the more attractive features of this choice will be in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now and to live , and maybe to do things slowly .
but a more important point that he is is : always who they choose for one thing to decide to do other things .
and these other things may have made of attractive traits , and it will be less powerful .
thirdly : <unk> of expectations .
this is struck me when i wanted my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in the only time , and they bought them , and they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , and if they had them and they had it and they had it and they had it and they have had it , and they had it , and they &apos;ve got it , and they &apos;ve got it . &quot;
so to buy new jeans , after a lot of years of the <unk> , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to be a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the monkey said , &quot; do you want to <unk> , <unk> or a long ?
do you want to buttons or <unk> ? &quot; or <unk> washed washed ?
do you want to do with holes ?
if you want to get off the lower , <unk> , blah blah blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i would like to the way that was the only kind of thing . &quot;
he had no idea what was , so i spent an hour so all the freaking jeans <unk> , and i &apos;ll say the store -- and i say the truth -- with the best i had .
i had better . all these choices would make me better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to explain myself .
the reason for that , i felt worse , with all these choices , my expectations for me , what a good good thing was going to be up with a good thing for a good .
i had very low expectations . i had no a very concrete than it was just in one way .
when they came in 100 species , it &apos;s a lot of you should have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i was expected to do , and what i was expected , and what i was was to do was a little bit about what i expected .
and that allows us to the lives of the people that are inevitably the expectations of how good people have to be like good .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of the <unk> knows this , because if you would , you all don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used to be better than anything was worse than everything was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience the <unk> surprise .
nowadays , in the world where we live in the world -- we &apos;re wealthy , the <unk> citizens , with perfection , with perfection , the best for you ever hope is the best thing that you can hope is as well as you expect it .
they never get pleasant because their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve come all -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short slow moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better , i didn &apos;t <unk> myself .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of the <unk> of a bad sitting sitting there , if you &apos;re dissatisfied , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible .
if hundreds of different kinds of things are available available , and you buy one that &apos;s a little , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is : you know .
they would have better .
with 100 different kinds of <unk> in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about what they accuse themselves .
now , in the <unk> world , in the last generation , in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> of this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have been so high because their standards have gone up , and then , if you have to explain these experiences themselves .
and so the <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re doing is a better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember .
this is the official <unk> project that we all hold it is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than than any , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice than something selection .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this period of time , we &apos;ve been improved this point of choice .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule question , which is what all these choices have enabled these kinds of choices in the developed societies , the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , who don &apos;t have the problem to great choice .
and the problem is they have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and frustrating is steve <unk> has told you about how this is a little bit of <unk> car car , it &apos;s a waste waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this is , expensive decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they even hurts .
they &apos;re concerned about that we are bad .
when something about what people have to make decisions of our society allows to the societies that would be the societies that would be the people improve the lives , but we would also improve it .
economists call this a <unk> application .
<unk> is going to worry about all the the , not only the poor -- because all of these great selection are us .
so , you read this cartoon , and you &apos;re going to see this cartoon , says , &quot; ah ! what this fish knows ?
you know nothing possible in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it .
and the more i thought about it , the more i i came to the point that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break it down the car , so that everything is possible , they have no freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break it down the way , so everything is going to get your satisfaction .
it increases the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is a metaphor <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects already talked about the human genome and what that might mean , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we launch from a new point , we &apos;ve got to share the biology and now we &apos;re trying to create the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life .
we always have to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think that many biologists are trying to understand and that &apos;s at different levels .
we have different ways to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized nearly 20 years , when we sequenced the <unk> , the transition of the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate , or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , a <unk> of a species that can replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a little smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes to get 500 or so that &apos;s .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . , but if we look at all these genes we &apos;re looking at one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this is a living cell to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way we &apos;re going to be , the the one that we have to synthesize the individual components and ask some of the fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , we can synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow these really large molecules to make these really large molecules that we &apos;ve never done before ?
and if we can do that , we can launch the chromosome ?
so a chromosome is this is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the <unk> of life , is exponentially .
our ability genetic code to write is very slowly , and we have to put our last point now on a reference curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it took a few years from a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to put a new technique to put these little pieces and repair the mistakes .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information that &apos;s phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made little bits , they made a <unk> , and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting phase came to when we took this piece of <unk> chemical , and we took a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and kill them back and kill e. coli .
i &apos;ve talked recently about the oil industry , and they said they &apos;d like this model .
they were laughing more than her .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that is actually able to build in a biological system .
but we wanted to go on a lot more , we wanted to build a whole chromosome chromosome . it has more than <unk> characters genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re putting it in <unk> from the size of the virus that we could vary the size of the <unk> of the <unk> to understand what the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to launch with digital information in computer computers , these digital information is really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome in 1995 , the <unk> was a mistake of a <unk> .
we found 30 mistakes at the <unk> of 30 mistakes , if we used the original sequence , never would have been possible .
part of the design is it to make pieces of the 50 letters and the other pieces of pieces of pieces are , to build smaller <unk> .
we have unique elements here here .
you may have heard that we have built in the <unk> .
think about it : we have a <unk> code : a , c , gs and ts .
so , this letters -- these letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s one more destiny for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first , we &apos;ve signed up .
some people were disappointed disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve made these pieces as we can only dissociate enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these repair and back together .
and we started making pieces , starting with <unk> the five to <unk> letters in the same time to make these together , and put them together and put them into the <unk> .
so in each step , we have these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we were trying to create a very robust process , which you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the <unk> to the point .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to these right , we &apos;re going to get over 100,000 base base -- then they won &apos;t be growing in e. it &apos;s beyond all the opportunities in modern biology , and we we did the other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called <unk> <unk> , which is used the biology to repair dna that can bring together these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called <unk> <unk> of three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field , that the chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything is just like it was like it .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dried , they can actually live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m sure life in space exists and moving , looking for contraband conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown there there are a lot of that there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we made these processes -- actually we &apos;ve used to use the right design of the pieces of the pieces we have them <unk> , and yeast automatically add these together .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s so a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
this is <unk> over a long six seconds .
this is the paper we &apos;ve just put it recently .
this is the <unk> letter in <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that has ever created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we print it with a <unk> of 10 and without any of the distances , it would include the <unk> of these genetic code .
now , how do we launch a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus very simple . it &apos;s a lot more complicated to bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to be easy if you &apos;re doing it in <unk> , as we &apos;re , you just take the nucleus , and you put another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about this .
so , in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell , but we &apos;ve just shown that you can actually a full transplant of a chromosome from one cell to other and that can activate them .
we &apos;re <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> , <unk> , these two as humans and mice , we we put some <unk> in this chromosome , we could select it to disrupt all the protein , and it was quite amazing as we put it into the protein , and it was quite amazing as we put it into the protein . and it was quite amazing as we put it into the protein . and it was quite amazing as we put it into the protein . and it was quite amazing as we put it into
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;re trying to get a little bit further .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here have taken a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every thousands of figures in just a second one second .
so people think evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes that are called the <unk> that are actually digest .
the chromosome that in the cell , it &apos;s not one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve put them .
it was <unk> in the cell , and then the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s <unk> blue because of the genes we put them .
and after a very short time , it had lost all characteristics of species and <unk> has totally been a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all of the proteins that changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re going to have .
it may sound like genomic <unk> , but we can change the <unk> , things quite dramatic change .
now i have argued that this is not the <unk> -- this is based on a mile of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be a new form of the cambrian explosion , which we could be able to put massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious to what we need .
we &apos;re at nine billion to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context , i was born in the year .
today , three people on this planet for every year in the year has been born in the year , within 40 years .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for nine to the nine .
we need five billion ton of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s hundreds of millions of gallons of drums on the day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire co2 of this material that goes on the atmosphere .
so we now , we &apos;ve got out of our discoveries from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and you see the diversity that came up .
we &apos;re going to find out the boundaries of the biodiversity of reality and the one of our idea .
we have technologies today because these fast <unk> , to do what we call to compute genetics .
so we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes to the day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or these processes to create <unk> , or drugs new vaccines , we can change with a small different biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , and so on .
this is a recording of this really <unk> <unk> that we &apos;re actually sitting and to design new species on the computer , are familiar with the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be , we know exactly what the genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re going to focus on fossil generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn corn for ethanol experiment .
we have the fuel of the <unk> and third generation that will be relatively soon , the much higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of biology has a huge impact on the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of their availability , if we see co2 as a material , and so we work on cells that are going to go and go to the cells that go to this way .
and we think we &apos;re the first time to be the fourth generation , and it &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a technique .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
it &apos;s living in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s turning co2 in methane in the use of hydrogen as a source of energy source .
we can study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could easily be able to be able to drive the co2 into the fuel to drive this process .
within a short of time , we may believe we could be able to solve one of the basic questions .
you know , we really -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of the entire industry industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on the same time that we use the same entry to do vaccines .
you saw it this year with flu , we &apos;re still a year , and you have a dollar too little , if it &apos;s the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s changed by using <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
it &apos;s like the future may be like to be able to be with changes , today &apos;s <unk> , <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and potentially <unk> .
we &apos;re making light light years from it , our goal is that we have a chance to survive a long enough to survive that might be . thank you very much .
so on the last ted conference , i have a primer on the lhc .
and i promised back to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as far as it . and for all those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a <unk> second after the universe -- and that &apos;s to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s just amazing unbelievable .
this is the machine under geneva .
we &apos;re taking pictures of these <unk> detectors in detectors .
this is what i work . it &apos;s called atlas atlas , <unk> , <unk> meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction atlas is to see the scale .
september last year , the machine ran into the first time .
and this image was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s caused the huge amount of <unk> in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> that the lhc was going to <unk> the lhc , with a part of the lhc to put a <unk> in particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know whether this is the largest <unk> of the , or this , as someone who went to google , and the front page was .
it means we have a cultural impact over to the scientific .
so about a week later , there was a problem with this wires , and this golden wires here here here .
these wires conduct <unk> <unk> when the machine goes on to <unk> .
now , the engineers are under you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t do . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford it because if you &apos;re very far down , they &apos;re going to be something called it .
so , in minus <unk> degrees , colder than the space between stars , these wires can withstand tension into tension .
in one of the connections , between the <unk> magnet in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and it comes up wires and <unk> <unk> <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is still amazing if you imagine the magnet over 20 pounds , and it &apos;s moving around about 30 centimeters .
so we then then then then damage about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to their way back to their way .
and by the end of march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up and expect to the first data in june or july , and we have our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , in a way of spark such a meter of the <unk> of the value of science and <unk> on the boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject this .
i think it &apos;s so difficult to think that we reach beyond our limitations , we make the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words to a english scientist , <unk> <unk> , who , as he was the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> , his <unk> , his <unk> , his <unk> , said , &quot; nothing &apos;s so dangerous for the creation of human spirit , and to think that our <unk> are <unk> . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing is my profession , but it &apos;s more of course than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and i &apos;m entertaining .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
but the recent is recent weird about my life and my career , i &apos;ve been doing my relationship to this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , different than all the previous books for some reason , and a large <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as i was going to be the extinction .
seriously -- the extinction <unk> !
for example , they come to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that success will never be <unk> ?
don &apos;t worry about it , they &apos;re all their life , and never make a book that &apos;s the anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really courage .
but worse , if i didn &apos;t remember remember that i was a teenager of the first time i was a writer , i was being a writer , i wanted to be a writer to be confronted with the same kind of <unk> reaction .
people said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t worry , ever succeeded ?
have you not afraid to kill you the humiliation of dying ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to live your life for life , and it never come and and you can die on a <unk> <unk> of dreams -- your mouth filled with bitter sitcom of failure ?
so about , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always been .
and i was still afraid of the things that no one would be on .
like algae -- and other things things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i think about , i think , why ?
is that bother ?
is it logically that by someone should be afraid of doing the work to do that work .
and what exactly exactly is with the creative enterprises , they &apos;re making us to make us more of the mutual mental quality -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years , he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you get it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the <unk> of <unk> <unk> people .
we seem to have a professional kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to be the reputation , mentally immensely deeply .
everything you have to do is , bitter <unk> of the really great minds just from the 20th century , looking at the 20th century , and they were young and many of their own hand .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , the <unk> seemed to be really neglected by their talent .
norman <unk> said shortly before his death in his last interview , <unk> every my books has been on me a little bit .
a very extraordinary statement that you can do about their work .
but we don &apos;t even a slightly we &apos;re talking about someone to say , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of view of this , and collective of course , we &apos;ve been the wisdom and collective of course , creativity and <unk> , and the end -- is always going to <unk> .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is this idea of getting it completely right ?
do you feel about it ? because with just a centimeter distance , i feel at this notion at all .
i think they were <unk> .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t see how to take over the next century .
i think it better when we do our great creative creative way to live .
and i definitely know that it was me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , this dark path of the presumption , like <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to be in writing from the world as the work is to be the <unk> success of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s probably the most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
this is the kind of thought that you can bring someone to get at nine in the morning , gin to drink . and i don &apos;t want .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i think of the <unk> , i think to be able to be able to design a way of <unk> psychological models .
somehow , i have to find a way of a way to be a certain distance to me and my very natural <unk> of how the reaction is going to be in the writing .
and while i was looking for models in the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies , to see if they might have better or more sophisticated ideas about whether they could help with creative , with the emotional ways that with creativity .
this is a way to me in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity of people are , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , who came from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks bears this <unk> <unk> creativity of creativity .
from liberia is known that he believed he was believed , he would have a <unk> , <unk> him from a distance .
the roman had the same idea , this kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> genius genius .
this is great . the didn &apos;t really mean that a genius was a very clever person .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature , believed that it was literally in the walls of a <unk> -- like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the performers and the performers and the performers and the <unk> of the work would make sense invisible and the outcome of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from your work .
and everybody knew that worked so , right ?
the artist of the <unk> was protected , like , for example , too much taboo , right ?
if your work brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you , and everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius , has had to have this .
if your work <unk> -- don &apos;t get your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was was paralyzed .
so the people in the west really have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s make the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mystery and there &apos;s no room for the mythical creatures that causes orders of divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to think that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people this , or give a genius , rather than that he &apos;s a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , one of the person &apos;s being thinks , or it &apos;s like the vessel that the pelvis and the essence and the the the the the of all of the divine and the essence , the the the the the the the the the the of all of the divine , creative , <unk> <unk> is a little bit too much more responsible to a much more responsible , to it a little bit of a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like somebody to ask the sun to swallow .
the <unk> and warps and warps and it creates all these <unk> expectations .
i think that this is that this <unk> <unk> has been <unk> our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s right -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps too to a age-old understanding of transcending the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just get the <unk> from 500 years from a <unk> talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who were really <unk> in this audience , the notion of -- -- basically , <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects .
i &apos;m not going to take all of you to this journey .
but the question i want to introduce to the , is , why not ?
why not that thinking about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense of how everything else i &apos;ve heard about , is the absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that -- like anyone knows it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , you &apos;re not always functional .
in fact , he can feel literally comfortable with it .
i had a encounter one of these encounter when i met the very extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , who are now over 90 , but she was a <unk> , she told me she was working on the fields . she told me she was working on the fields . she said she was <unk> in the fields . she said , &quot; she would feel like her in the <unk> virginia . she said , she would feel , and i said she &apos;d be <unk> .
she said it would be like a <unk> train .
the country would be on the land on her .
she felt , if it came out , because it would bring the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that it was just a moment in a moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> races like the devil .
they ran like the devil in the house while she was haunted by this poem , it was just enough they quickly get too much too much too much on paper and a pen that you had to get through them and dive and on the sheet .
others didn &apos;t have fast enough . they ran and ran , and she ran , but she would roll the house , and the poem rolled through her and she didn &apos;t leave it . she didn &apos;t know it . she said , <unk> after a second poet .
and then these moments , i &apos;m never forget -- she said that there was the moments in which they almost miss it .
so , she &apos;s going to go to the house and you look after paper and the poem is going through and she picks up a pencil , as it &apos;s through them and then , and then she said , it was like to grab your other hand and grab it .
she released the poem on his tail and she pulled back into her body , and she took it on the sheet of paper .
and so , in these occasions , this poem was <unk> and intact on paper -- but backward -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought , this is creepy -- this is exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not as my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . to work , i have to get up every day , and sweat , <unk> and really awkward <unk> .
but even even in my <unk> , sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess many of you have done it .
i mean , i had to work or ideas that came from a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we communicate with this without losing our mind , but to the opposite even the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this , the musician tom <unk> . i was going to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of his life , who was trying to negotiate these <unk> of creativity that lived in his own , and with them with you .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he was driving a freeway on a freeway in los angeles , and there &apos;s all changed for him .
he was running high speed as he suddenly hear a little fragment of a melody , which is a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s difficult to him , and he wants to be <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t conceive it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he didn &apos;t have a pen , he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so , he begins , this old <unk> in him up , like <unk> i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be haunted by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just stopped .
he finished all of the time , and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; <unk> excuse me , you can &apos;t see that i drive car ?
<unk> is i look like this , i could just write a song ?
if you really want to get to a second moment , when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else &apos;s another .
go and <unk> cohen cohen .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it was often dark as ever as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , he &apos;s carrying it , he was when he was the genius of himself , where he was not in trouble and he <unk> where he would like to come from in trouble , he realized that it was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also has a bit of the way i worked and it &apos;s got to be saved .
this idea of me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i fell in one of these these these these these these these these were all the <unk> we fall on , and it doesn &apos;t work , and it &apos;s not going to work . you start thinking it &apos;s a disaster . it &apos;s the worst book .
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i began thinking , i should just be the project .
but then i remembered how tom was spoken to the free sky , and i tried to .
so i took my view of the manuscript , and i talked my comment on a blank corner of the room .
i talked loudly : <unk> , you know , you know , and i &apos;m both , if this book is not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all going to have , i have no longer than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to leave up here and you &apos;re driving on the agreement .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to go to the protocol , i want to be my part of the jobs today .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . so centuries ago in the desert <unk> people with holy dances and music , for hours , to dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special , one of the performers was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen a performance in your life once you have seen this .
it was like the time , and the dancers through a kind of <unk> , he did nothing different than he has done it -- 1,000 nights ago , but everything that &apos;s got together .
and suddenly , it didn &apos;t seem to be human .
it was illuminating in the inside , and down down , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so , as something happened at that time , people knew what was called it . they called it .
they put the hands together and started singing , <unk> <unk> , god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> came came to this , and the pronunciation was the over the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and you hear it .
if an artist in spain , something magical did something magical , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great <unk> <unk> -- there is a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning , when the dancer wakes up and realize that 11 : 11 : it &apos;s a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a <unk> of god .
it &apos;s only a <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> knees , and maybe he will never get to these altitudes .
and maybe someone will never name god names when he &apos;s spinning , but what do he start with the rest of his life ?
it &apos;s hard .
this is one of the <unk> &apos;s corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much as much of <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe that most extraordinary aspects of their existence came from them .
if you just think , if you think they &apos;re a loan -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of their lives that someone passed on someone else when they &apos;re ready to do .
when we start thinking about this , it &apos;s all changing .
so i started thinking , and i think i think i think i was working with safety in the last months , while i was working on the book , and it &apos;s become a dangerous , frightening , enjoyable to my <unk> success .
what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself , if i &apos;m crazy , i &apos;m not afraid .
not <unk> .
just your job .
keep it to your contributions to be there , whatever he may be .
if your job is dance , dance dance .
if the dumb divine genius , that &apos;s the to you , you choose to show a a brief moment of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> !
and if not , dance dance , dance nonetheless .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , in all of this .
i believe that , and i feel like this , we should teach this .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , in all of this , just for you , you know , you know , you know the mere human love and the <unk> , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
yay !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which has declined about nearly three million years , the size of the lower states , 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press very well enough to this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the the arctic <unk> is beating the beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and summer in summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a <unk> of what &apos;s happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red marks .
as you see , it grows on the <unk> , this is the year of the winter ; and it &apos;s summertime in summer .
this is what we call <unk> , five years old , and older , almost as blood , which is from the body here .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here for 25 years .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen source to the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of carbon dioxide carbon , which is when it <unk> , from microbes , from microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of the amount of the amount of the water , it could double if we transcend this critical period .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , in alaska , from the water .
professor <unk> walter in the university of alaska is with another group on another flat sea last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous reservoir is hot greenland and the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know , the sea level through <unk> is going down to sea , they &apos;re going to the sea .
these rivers are going to be a very quickly .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest <unk> of the planet on the planet .
last month , researchers , the entire continent has a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> that popped over a few <unk> of <unk> is particularly heavily in the melt .
this is the equivalent of 20 feet of <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , look at the top of the lakes that were actually going to see a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world are going to get half their <unk> from this <unk> .
in the andean &apos;s <unk> , this glacier is the <unk> of this city .
the <unk> have expanded .
but when you <unk> , it will be <unk> the most drinking water .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in california has seen the sierra leone .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read it , are seriously .
these <unk> in all over the world has to fire a dramatic proportion .
and the disasters around the world have never been <unk> to a really <unk> extent .
four times as many years in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of tons of carbon is <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the realm of the eastern pacific , right , from the american continent , and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there are a dramatic decline in the oceans .
the largest factor of global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , it &apos;s burning from fossil fuels .
it &apos;s a problem , and coal is the most biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest <unk> , combined with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more <unk> .
but we start seeing a change .
here are the ones that have been taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
there &apos;s a political dispute in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> , have spent a <unk> dollar on the <unk> to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction .
this picture reminded me something .
so , for christmas , in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of the <unk> <unk> .
this was a christmas day .
one of the commercials on the <unk> party was this .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> is a <unk> , happy boy .
it &apos;s in the skin and plenty of america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> is a cleaner every day cleaner .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers remain in cash and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , <unk> <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate domination has been called the same for the world .
this is one , part of your .
at the <unk> , we see climate climate as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it up to the supreme <unk> , a substantial <unk> to spend a <unk> on the way to get a <unk> on the way to get the truth about coal .
the fact is coal is not messy .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and smells good well .
so , they &apos;re not concerned about climate change .
leave it to us .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet , the burning burning of one of the main main is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , everything is changing .
look at this , this is the <unk> world today , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of homeland security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that unites these together is our dependence on the <unk> fuels like the filthy coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us out of this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , make us feel secure , to help global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough is to solve our problems .
<unk> america is new . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , the filthy fuels that are all the world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good for the very good for jobs .
<unk> america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african <unk> , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get too far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s quickly .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to ask the time their childhood when they were playing with <unk> .
and as they realized , as you look at the hands , and <unk> , and move the <unk> , they actually learned to change and to change problems through understanding and change the context of what we can change .
spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with physical objects -- with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computers , and it would be able to be able to wonder , and what if we want to use computers , instead of a <unk> , which is like a digital <unk> on a flat <unk> .
and this question was so <unk> that we decided to answer exploration and <unk> .
in a nutshell , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move around the hand , you can see each other , you can track and you have a screen and you have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are physically , you can just put them out of the time that you can move your hands and access your hands .
and the <unk> is an example of a new generation of <unk> to the nanoscale digital data .
and when these are physical physical and a conscious of consciousness are developing , and the subtleties of our <unk> , with them , we can start with the exploration of new and more entertaining .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this is a <unk> <unk> , and when i put it into a direction , the video goes forward , when i <unk> it into the other direction , it &apos;s backwards .
and these interactive portraits are looking at each other .
so , when i put them next side of it , you &apos;ll be interested in your interest .
when they &apos;re surrounded by the <unk> , you &apos;ll notice , and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re feeling their movements and attracting your own movements .
so an interesting outgrowth of the interactions we started to see is that we could use everyday gestures on data , like colors like , like , like , like , like , do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to cast color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we exaggerate it , we can make a little bit of <unk> .
there also also also some nice ways in education as languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we want to give people the opportunity to the and the results of the fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series i &apos;m with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of every <unk> in the <unk> , and while you try to form words , they &apos;re going to be tested this about a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , it gets mixed and you have a new <unk> and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to a trip from the media lab . i could move them to try and try it and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
a interesting fact that this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many orders .
everything you have to say is &quot; you &apos;re words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s a couple of people who are testing .
this is our youngest <unk> down there on the bottom right .
it turns out he wanted to stack the <unk> just pile .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is a interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> plan for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters in the scene by sending the <unk> off the table of the table , which this character shows .
here it lets it be the sun .
the sun goes on on .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange hybrid .
good work ! yes !
by using the <unk> and she &apos;s shaking by the side of he can interact with the characters .
and his own story is invent .
hi .
it &apos;s a story with open and it can decide how they evolve .
flying cat .
the last example , for me today , i &apos;ve been showing now , is a <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed recently and <unk> as a sound like <unk> , bass and drum .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can assemble in any patterns .
and you &apos;re <unk> them by just by just a <unk> of a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you tie it with a certain tone , and it &apos;s a <unk> it &apos;s then .
and then even the brain effects like the speed and volume that you put in the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in that we &apos;re going to put the <unk> into two <unk> and and put them in a row , and they expand and more more the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something drums .
and now i connect the filter with the drums so i can drive the effect .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , by the speed of a or other direction .
and now i connect the filters with the bass , for something more expression .
i can get the sequence as it .
and so , by doing it , i don &apos;t have to plan it in advance , but can replicate it , and more than even more .
and i finally , i can <unk> the whole sequence by the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my enthusiasm , to develop new <unk> , which is better to the way our brains and bodies work .
and i had time to share with you a part of these new <unk> and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the conclusion , is that we are at the brink of this new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media , the information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you .
yes , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very excited that i am there .
so , so what should be <unk> ?
i just have to step back , and it &apos;s just engaged in modern biology .
i study biology and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years , and i started to know , because i wanted to know , and it was particularly , to do , and it wanted to make it even more and even doing it , what i &apos;ve learned in studying thinking .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the biology in general now , so generally talked about biotechnology , biotechnology , everything you do , synthetic biology and so on .
crucially , it &apos;s very important , now , and much more importantly , will be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so <unk> things like these these genetically genetically engineered plants on the <unk> .
there &apos;s now craig venter now in the <unk> of the <unk> , to make gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s things that are really stuck in the day-to-day life , which most people are not aware of , for example , the <unk> that allows us to wash , with 40 degrees of laundry , are also genetically layered enzymes .
and the list can continue endlessly on endlessly .
and so , from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m going to keep on <unk> .
so what was a <unk> ?
most of the most people know that from the <unk> .
computers <unk> , and then it gets like , the hackers break into a somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a lot of the <unk> <unk> , because it doesn &apos;t really tell you what they actually started , and what it &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also done the internet .
and it &apos;s about with a design , creative , engineering ways to solve a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not only a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a <unk> , which is like , you can make a any <unk> , a question , and how do you make it differently , and how can you make it better .
and it &apos;s got it with software , but there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that with <unk> all kinds of things .
and now , now , you know , in the direction , and i &apos;m like to this metaphor , which is a <unk> that comes from synthetic biology , is that biology is actually a <unk> , because , the <unk> code is a more complex code , which is , it &apos;s a kind of thing , because it &apos;s more , because it &apos;s more , because it &apos;s more .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and you can also hack it , and i find incredibly fascinating , and i wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
it actually actually <unk> eight times , to be able to do these these networks .
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is to europe and with a cooperation in india in india , but there &apos;s a members of the people who have now members or active people around the world .
and that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and work with scientists with some ways to do with these technologies and ask and to make the creative and ask and to process and creative , there &apos;s <unk> and yes , everything else .
but it &apos;s always about that way to find a <unk> access to a <unk> way to have a kind of thing to do .
and then there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , it &apos;s actually a kind of forum , where where you hang out and online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and a little bit of <unk> , there are like , they &apos;re asking , well , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have all the popular , has been so a scene i &apos;d like to leave .
here &apos;s the picture on the top side , you &apos;re looking at <unk> , which is a <unk> , basically a kind of school , a private school , a non-profit institution , where anyone can .
kids , old , all kinds of people go and so , and they have a lab and look at what can you do , if you do this <unk> .
there &apos;s a group in indonesia , <unk> is that , but there &apos;s a long time .
it &apos;s been more than these two networks .
and the way in such artistic aspect of this with biologic materials and , yes , and combine it quite a <unk> way .
a group of ankara i met a while ago , this is a <unk> , which would like to convey the public , what they learn in college and they &apos;re trying to explain and explain what &apos;s <unk> .
and i put up in the other picture a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in a <unk> of the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that what one is actually , is this fascination with technology .
and what you can do with it , and also , to society and ask , you know , okay , what do you want to do , you have their interest in doing this way to bring you with this way ?
so , <unk> , to make biology , you need to get materials .
you need to use biological materials , and you need it , and that &apos;s a lab .
and what you &apos;re normally understands in a lab , these are sort of <unk> machines , extremely <unk> , <unk> academics , trained academics with ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , <unk> , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do it .
it &apos;s not necessary , because every every one has any <unk> has higher technology than most <unk> , that &apos;s really .
and it &apos;s my with that premise with this premise , for example , brian <unk> in england , it &apos;s trying to put a <unk> <unk> , and then took a <unk> , a <unk> , and , and , and it &apos;s then bacteria .
so every one , once you know , a soup of soup that he has gone too long , even did it .
so i was trying to get back to my lab , a little bit , and then i would put on ebay on ebay and a little bit of <unk> analysis , trying to make a <unk> , so , like this as a <unk> <unk> , so , like this as a <unk> <unk> , so , like this as a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m going home .
now , this is not a joke now , but it &apos;s .
here in the bottom , you see this lab , in <unk> , so this is so a <unk> garage with so much kinds of <unk> that i &apos;ve got in college , a group in paris , a group in paris , and that &apos;s what they have in and pretty well , i want to make a project .
and this is <unk> , which is also mentioned , this is , kind of a kind of <unk> principle for molecular biology .
and so , yeah , you see it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s just to people who are doing this home , to large , to large , larger organizations that have been more <unk> in <unk> form .
but just always the idea of the approach is that it &apos;s easy to be easy and accessible to it .
the first project we &apos;ve done as a international group , when we were aware of ourselves , <unk> , we &apos;re now in this as real as we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re so eager to do this and and and and so forth .
and then the <unk> website came website , the founder , and we &apos;ve got to be able to make us really , and then , and then , and then , have a lot of <unk> , and then it &apos;s got two events , one in london , <unk> 10 , and shortly after it , san francisco .
and , there it was also about , yes , who are we , what are we want to say , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our objective goals , our foundation ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
so this was quite intuitive , so everybody &apos;s just so his wish , his and what it goes down , they put it , put it .
there &apos;s where i think , is a very good code .
and then we don &apos;t have it , but it &apos;s all , i think , has been relatively good , people are quite persuaded by this .
and we even try to do it , too , too , in academia , but there it &apos;s not something like that .
so i think we &apos;re out of the <unk> , in the way , even one step further than the world &apos;s academia .
so , what do we do for projects are actually going to do this ?
a project that i did with the <unk> of switzerland , was that we wanted to be a marker of optical trap or optical <unk> .
this is , if you focus a beam of a laser , you can put in a space , you can put some particles in the air or in the fluid and then move into this focus , so , and then , it &apos;s been trapped in this focus , so like a <unk> principle .
it really works , it &apos;s made up in the academic , and we thought , <unk> , we may also , then , have a webcam , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , you have a microscope , it &apos;s blown up around .
this is the bottom there .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then the laser laser <unk> the laser and then try to focus on this camera .
and that hasn &apos;t work unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so another project that comes from from the french group in this , and this is pretty cool .
and he &apos;s so one thing that &apos;s like a <unk> , like this , like this , or something like this , so he &apos;s engaged with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then built this this helmet because in cooperation with the museum , the museum is the .
and then there was the visitors in the room , sitting on this chair , put on this chair .
then you measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , is there &apos;s different lights in the space .
it was a pretty quite <unk> project .
another thing from the united states , which is also with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying , sharing genes , to replicate , <unk> , in some ways that you can see them .
so , if i do that , i &apos;m going to make the <unk> of the earth &apos;s space , then you get any <unk> , and then they turn this this technique , and then you can say , <unk> , this kind of this technique , and then you can say , <unk> , this hair belongs to this person .
and the machines that make this stuff , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy commercially , the cheapest , go to <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in the <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do it .
so this is just a application of many that you can do it .
and they &apos;ve been so two of these hobbyists hobbyists and said , <unk> , that we make it easier and cheaper , and then we set out of open source , so free source , so that this device is <unk> and so , and the cheapest <unk> chain of these are <unk> .
i think there &apos;s like 100 dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still in a scale in the way it &apos;s clearly available .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> hack .
so a project that i started to to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about as far , two centimeters or so .
you pour <unk> <unk> and then put the <unk> into this <unk> , and then i put it on a <unk> and then put it so that they &apos;re like this .
so the device that you see there it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is so my prototype , but it &apos;s so much of my prototype , but it &apos;s like a branch , the thing on , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , and that was the pressure , and that was broken .
and then i took a <unk> and it was attached to it .
one <unk> , if you get the full power of water , so that enough pressure , so i think , 40 to the <unk> bar .
and so you can get the particles strong enough enough and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros or something , <unk> , to 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically it it &apos;s basically .
so that &apos;s the moment , the <unk> of the scene , the the <unk> of the scene , and the information and the <unk> <unk> , that more people can get into .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a little bit of it and also not a chance to form themselves .
because , if you read about it , from <unk> , this is not the same as if you did it yourself or saw it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make sense of as a citizen citizen , the society can be able to be able to get to improve society , and then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand how to make it and understand .
and then the <unk> then , under the <unk> open <unk> and the citizen science .
so , as citizens as citizens , you &apos;re going to be able to get into the way with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least at least on the website , <unk> website .
this is already a relatively substantial number of people around the world .
and interesting is also , that they are now going to be in southeast asia .
this is me , that &apos;s because there are fewer people holding it in the way .
so i know from some of some who don &apos;t have .
and these are just the <unk> of the people who are individual people .
in part of these <unk> , these places , in this place .
and that &apos;s very , very beginning .
like , <unk> has just begun .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is a giant network of very good , yes , <unk> that are all over the world .
and we hope , of course , we &apos;re going to hold up to us , and then they &apos;re too well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as
and i would invite everybody to go to the way to try and try and try and try .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not possible , if you have enough enough , and enough energy , you get there too .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving very much as a designer , but also in the <unk> of the <unk> and in front of all sorts of things in the domain of the world .
it &apos;s about how you &apos;ve been able to run people in interactive media so so they can use these interactive media and make it a very much experience of experience .
and i think that the interactive media in us , in us , cognitive models , so paradigm , which are in our biology , very long time , and we can now create a <unk> of interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> , you &apos;ve met with the future , but actually it &apos;s like the future is exactly the future of us , with our <unk> roots .
so what are actually more sophisticated models ?
i &apos;d like to write four <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain to the story .
to <unk> cognitive models , that is the models we have in the pre-industrial times .
to this <unk> models of modern models , we have basically have natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds , basically , it &apos;s a little bit unusual .
so i &apos;m going to go back to it , and i &apos;m going to give you through trial , you have to have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to speak about this <unk> models , but even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself itself .
we know that the interactive media is called by definition , which is the <unk> of linearity , and what we of course says we are now feeling the value of normal .
the fourth part is that the story is a place for us to be a place of the .
now , like this is the one that is the most basic thing about the world is .
i &apos;d like to prove it to you .
how many doors have the house that they live in ?
we won &apos;t immediately to answer to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s the reality , and it &apos;s a whole computer .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a way to show you the virtual reality in our <unk> , , we can actually do it all the time .
and this this capacity to be the reality that the reality that have been the the pre-industrial times as well as well as well as well , nothing had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have a lot of mass .
the only thing that had was their head .
and in this head , it was playing with memory .
in this head , knowledge and using these virtual images , the imagination , has been passed on .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that the human being <unk> and medium was at the same time .
now , if you think of a little bit more .
what are media today ?
then you notice that it has been a change .
but i &apos;ll get to talk to it again .
the primary tool of the <unk> has been been telling stories .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , they were to get some of the <unk> to keep knowledge .
and also today we &apos;re still very , very powerful to stories .
the author of the book , the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , we still <unk> a year , <unk> hours with the <unk> of stories .
it means for a child that &apos;s going to be the most of the time of the most of the most of the time of his life with the <unk> of the time .
now we think our love to stories is that we sat on the other hand of our parents .
no , no , very far missing .
this is a lot more further back , in the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the area of interactive media as a particularly impressive , we have to have <unk> <unk> in our biology of our biology , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i &apos;ve brought you an example of the north coast tribe of the north tree .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to navigate it somehow , from island to island to raise food .
and they did this with something called <unk> .
you may know , you know , if you &apos;re interested in the australian world .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a <unk> , but they have used as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topology of the regions of the regions could be encountered .
and the language of <unk> was recognized , <unk> was .
that &apos;s called , you <unk> about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topology of a region , and that also has also allowing these songs and and they could recombine and so on the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again , and again , to the left and again
why don &apos;t we sing about the top of a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what what &apos;s happened in this ?
and this is the <unk> age age .
we &apos;ve got to move through the way that we call <unk> .
what happened is that age age and is the book and it &apos;s happening is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the their own production of our individual memories , on the top media .
on the book and on the picture .
so we &apos;re the unfortunately of god &apos;s a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
virtuality is suddenly alien from us from us , and has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> of the <unk> , is so far to say that this mass mass , he says the book and the image , so , not television , and the internet and so on , and so on , and the internet and so on , and so on , and so on , what we have <unk> our ability and our ability to <unk> our ability and our ability to <unk> our ability and our ability to <unk> our ability .
let &apos;s make a little <unk> .
from the <unk> age age .
what determines our minds in our thinking and our <unk> ?
then the <unk> of the pre-industrial culture are the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more <unk> in the course of centuries , through the influences of the <unk> .
that means , instead of what we &apos;re going to do is , we have a lot of common , highly pervasive patterns of memories that we can hang our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have a high-level language . we have a high-level language .
we don &apos;t ask the thing to do more in images that don &apos;t look into images , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;re used to us that things are linear .
and we have the linearity of law and there are only exceptions , like , for example , the <unk> .
what &apos;s stayed with it &apos;s the <unk> .
still we are the <unk> as a <unk> , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going to come ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had the age age , and we &apos;re going to take a <unk> version of the <unk> .
this sounds very <unk> and sounds very <unk> fiction , i know .
but these ideas of the <unk> , these are bringing us to explore our skills back to our skills .
there it &apos;s about virtuality . it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain this a little bit .
there &apos;s technical concepts like this , like this , as as as the <unk> reality reality , that is the extended reality .
so , if you look at google , you know , you &apos;re looking at , you know , a concept that makes us to combine the virtual world with the real world , which is our <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that is virtual as a normal , natural , it will be addressed .
another example is something called the virtual reality .
so , of course , this is what my presentation sounds like this , we &apos;re moving into <unk> , virtual worlds , the model of the <unk> .
and other other one another example is the <unk> , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to people .
all this needs the ability to accept virtuality in virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated in and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , this is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and the two <unk> are also today today .
maybe you &apos;ll get up to the very quickly , so you can get to break the two over the project .
and this project , i &apos;ve brought me as an example of how to bring back to this <unk> , cognitive models .
all of this is a game , i have to say to it .
and what the <unk> of course , is extremely <unk> and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say , computer games , you &apos;ve probably very likely to get any people from any <unk> <unk> or that they play with some <unk> of the hand .
so anyway , they &apos;re doing it in the case .
this is a game for outside .
and this is what i think i think the outside world , so i discover the world .
and this game joins the virtual world , so the data that we produce with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i have to be so much .
you can tell you a lot better , there &apos;s more much more than it .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what places are positive or negative <unk> .
and so i get the city a whole sight , and i see a whole , , i see negative zones of a city and a whole different way , a different way , virtual <unk> , a very real city .
and we can like to look at the time .
ah , what you can see here , i &apos;m going to see , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , yes .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to share my talk to my talk and the skills that we &apos;ve made from the <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a little <unk> in the age age , and that &apos;s the same time that we &apos;re going to be on the age of the age age , and that we can actually come back to this way , and we &apos;re in the future , but it actually is that we &apos;re going to come back to the future , but it actually is that we &apos;re going back to
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very happy to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be whether this bag is there a <unk> bag , and my rather than being talking about .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m going to dissolve in all the things that &apos;s in there .
but i &apos;m just going to do it just a little bit .
yes , kids are inherently curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m inspired by the house , so i &apos;m also looking at the subject of curiosity and how changing our thinking , and why don &apos;t we have to be <unk> and and we have to adapt it again and so on .
this is a whole set of things that you &apos;re doing to the actual act of a , acting .
when professors are being , they &apos;re often going to <unk> in the n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a <unk> of the subject of natural users .
now you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the way to work with this natural natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i think one of these little devices up up , because things are always supposed to be more more and more natural , and there &apos;s got to be , and you can see , what &apos;s actually , for us , of course , what is <unk> or intuitively .
and before the background , i have a piece of user interface , so the next generation of human beings in the relationship with human beings , how to use our tools or how the computer &apos;s the computer , <unk> , for the digital assistant , the computer assistant .
so i &apos;ve been engaged with this , when it &apos;s , of course , is intuitively .
maybe even have a look at this .
why does this happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a short way , we &apos;re moving now from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern <unk> .
every society is shaped by a <unk> .
the beginning the <unk> through the language .
that means you &apos;ve been found that you &apos;ve talked a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it has moved into other areas , cities , cities , and <unk> <unk> .
but the language was , but the language , something very natural , something very living .
so , you had to learn to learn , you can &apos;t learn a toddler , but we learn to <unk> and standards .
and then this is the way through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
it was a <unk> at the time , because you &apos;re of course , the <unk> language started to <unk> in the form of scripture , what &apos;s going to go and alive and i <unk> it in stone , and i <unk> it .
depending on how i <unk> and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a whole different narrative when it &apos;s a living in a sense of life .
but then , <unk> , this typeface was as <unk> , and then .
then the next generation we came in today , in fact , primarily .
this is the same thing that &apos;s through pressure and <unk> <unk> typeface with <unk> and others .
at the time , it was just a <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other words , are you really insane when the people start to read , then they want to get the people that would want to be , and this is , of course , is totally <unk> .
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting thing is so a <unk> is just a few hundred years and we &apos;re really in this <unk> phase that we &apos;re doing .
and the confused of course , is totally , because we see on the one side of the new media , social media , facebook and so on .
with absolute transparency , which is the new thinking of what the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> <unk> and no beef , but i just want to <unk> this just <unk> and i want to <unk> this .
and these two worlds , the are just the , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , when you look at this , these new society , these <unk> , <unk> very many mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but it &apos;s not going to be a local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s a subject of ecology is a global global .
not when i think local <unk> , and your neighbor thinks less organic , it doesn &apos;t work much more .
this is , from the local village , actually , a global , global principles , as well as well as well , as well , the total transparency .
so as you knew at the time in the village , what about whom and when , this is what this expansion of our self is through these mobile devices , on global .
it &apos;s that we know about global and faster and more and better .
it &apos;s like it used to be on the village .
so , in front of the background , i just started to see what is , what is , of course , what we might have , what we might have , what &apos;s the difference for us , so what does the difference ?
because often , people are , can &apos;t make it <unk> so that everybody can deal with it .
so you have to engage with it , which is , and not just it it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s supposed to be better .
and whenever it &apos;s natural , of course , and as i can take a kind of a kind of a kind of way , and you just make the things that they &apos;re so intuitive , so they &apos;re fun , because they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re just fun and they &apos;re just using it .
you &apos;re also engaged in the time , as i was thinking about the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and this is also what you start and look like and look like , and look , okay , now i &apos;m going inside inside itself .
and what &apos;s it actually in there in this ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re there ?
and what does actually mean , of course , intuitively , and how do our channels of perception and how does the cognitive processing works ?
because steve jobs has said you <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> it <unk> .
so you really have to look at the detail detail , if i want to make something or intuitively <unk> , which is the core .
and there you see , you know , a our seven senses , most of the things we &apos;ve got five , now , it &apos;s actually seven seven , because it &apos;s certainly going to be the next , an eighth sense , and as an extension , and then we &apos;re in our self .
and to look at how do we do information , how do we take information ?
and it alone says , what &apos;s information ?
information is every difference in this is a difference .
a lot of using the word , but don &apos;t even know what it means in detail .
but i have to understand at the core of the understanding , when you get information to information , when you get from data information and from information , so i know how to make things like this , and we can make things like this , or , of course , and it can make things like this , or , of course , and it can make things like this , or of course , and it can make things like this , or of course , and it can make things like this , or of
and of course , how does design influence on perception .
so we see this here , when i design things , i can make them a little bit of the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it kind of intuitive , to show things .
so , very much natural , in a <unk> , but i see directly , where salt and pepper pepper .
and when i say somebody , give me salt or pepper , you &apos;ll start thinking about where is inside .
and the left just intuitive and and then hopefully that there &apos;s no sugar in there , and then you can be able to get it .
but also our perception self , how does it mean , too , it &apos;s too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right now looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equal to the size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we are doing things .
anybody know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should work .
there &apos;s been more about my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n .
a second circle begins to relate to relate to function .
and then , when i take a <unk> , we &apos;re seeing at once , we &apos;re not even seeing a single one , which is circle , and , but we see a unit , we &apos;re not seeing three pieces , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> or just <unk> , which is affected us in perception .
and so important for the designers , the most of the most <unk> , the great <unk> .
<unk> of the , <unk> the continuity and so forth .
so often , in the third time , again .
but this is essential important in the way that you just want to make things like this , you want to make it very intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting to see that &apos;s looking at this .
sounds very banal , but so interesting , is to be more difficult , if you &apos;re engaged .
so we have the front of the eyes and now think , we &apos;re looking back in the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , they &apos;re looking at the back .
and they &apos;re <unk> a assumption , and we &apos;re seeing something you can see , <unk> circle .
this is , we &apos;re just going to see our <unk> , before we see it back back to our <unk> <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
i have a cognitive <unk> , you have a cognitive <unk> , you have what you want to see .
so that &apos;s then there , then it comes back again .
then again again again , because the back of the back and says , but i &apos;m really going to ask you , and you &apos;re sure what you &apos;re seeing , what you want to see .
and then again , it goes back back , and then it &apos;s actually seen it .
so , a very , very <unk> process , how certain things are going on and what do these things happen for these things .
i don &apos;t know who knows this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something like this .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s actually aware .
does anybody see something like ?
a <unk> , right .
and when i saw this once , that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know it .
they never forget it , because i &apos;m showing you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and so on , you see it always .
that means , i didn &apos;t know , i didn &apos;t know that they don &apos;t see any patterns of a pattern , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short time , and again , again , this dog in this <unk> picture .
and this is this projection of view , <unk> , look at this .
now i know it &apos;s now , and now i &apos;m going to see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that are in this , right , you know , grey is actually not , but here &apos;s the same <unk> crowd in this <unk> .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know , something takes three seconds to the present , i can also bridge very well <unk> in which i &apos;m doing it by doing a few seconds .
it &apos;s just to process it as present .
then it goes into the past , and i can bridge , i can bridge to the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does you want milliseconds milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
and it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the time of the time that you fall in love .
that means you imagine , if you know it &apos;s now , you know , you know , you know , because i don &apos;t see a <unk> for what can happen to it .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the course of the most sensations we have .
this is , this first idea is happening at a fast fast speed of how we perceive things .
and as we see things also , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we kind of ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the creator of course , not only the subject of perceptions , neural <unk> or <unk> , but primarily with the subject of the <unk> .
so , as a human being a human way accordingly .
so there &apos;s a <unk> of these handy features , so there &apos;s such a lifelike aspects or <unk> aspects .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i have to reach out .
but there are also symbolic functions , why are someone for such a little <unk> , where anyway , you know , just the <unk> money on money , even though it &apos;s not so much as good ?
we &apos;re more like to the <unk> , on the <unk> of the <unk> that we care of course as natural course .
back to my actual subject of natural user interface and the subject , of course , is <unk> .
<unk> is always , how can i make it a little goal or how can a user could be effective in a certain <unk> system , efficiently and <unk> .
this is what it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i make a little bit more <unk> ?
can i be able to use that , or i need the n manual or i need an ant training for it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i &apos;m just going to make it a different way , and i &apos;m not doing it , it &apos;s better <unk> .
you have to understand .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen it , you &apos;ll understand why <unk> percent of our today &apos;s software is intuitive or not <unk> , or <unk> , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than traditional software .
and this is intuitive <unk> , not for the apple &apos;s a fundamental <unk> , <unk> elementary <unk> , when i just want to harness technological devices .
why ?
because in the rule , we through this new kind of <unk> , which is natural user , for example , five times five times faster at the destination .
you have to imagine that , if you do something like the classic <unk> , five hours and with this new kind of natural software is only an hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re going to go home four hours , but you can &apos;t even wait a <unk> or anybody &apos;s going to have a <unk> , and you can do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , is a corresponding <unk> , even of things .
so , if we &apos;re going to put in the field of software , this is the first <unk> interface that were very intricate , where you &apos;ve got months to deal with these systems .
then the next thing that we came up with the <unk> , or mental model like the software <unk> , they have , because you have a notion of something , the metaphor of a desktop to harness the computer .
so don &apos;t get a ones and zeros or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s still a lot better .
the next generation of the <unk> <unk> works very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing as a designer , a lot more more more more more more more than that .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
i once think that &apos;s always the way that they &apos;re always going to succeed , the <unk> of the <unk> .
and when i even step into this kind of thing in this natural user interface , where i &apos;m with voice , by the <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , by <unk> , and <unk> things , and then i &apos;m still on and i &apos;m still on .
so that leads me to the point , when when are the things are more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to my little friend of my little friend here and see , what does this mean , you know , from the <unk> view , when is now , really , what &apos;s really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always a very intuitive for us , if i have to think about it .
so , he doesn &apos;t like to think about it , but we can &apos;t do it .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive .
and what does that mean for designers ?
this is , if we look at the existing <unk> of something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do this as a designer .
that means i can just translate this a intuitive , human <unk> software software to software and make the software significantly <unk> .
now , of course , the question is , what is actually the most <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;ve been .
this is what we call <unk> .
it &apos;s using any of us and <unk> is an acronym , and you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and that &apos;s all the power of you all of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s also intuitively , and also instinctively .
the model is going to be <unk> in the womb and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works at the world and old , and it &apos;s been using all the time , without that most have been the way that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times from us , in your sleep , so you &apos;ve found it less often more than the day .
so i can now now , this mental <unk> , <unk> , you know , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
and through this kind of elimination , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> , as the national classic metaphor is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and if i &apos;m now <unk> , for example , when i <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the case , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in detail , and i &apos;m going to send it somewhere or a <unk> or shop , and so on , and i can send it out or shop , or shop and so on .
then i can transfer it up .
i &apos;m going to take this through a <unk> .
just ate cake .
now , in now , i use this with the object , again , again , <unk> .
i get the whole of the whole point of the , can now filter and and say , show me all the thing with chocolate for example .
and once again , a interface , which is more intuitive and very much more natural .
because that i can grab things like the piece , and you can get it to me , is much more natural than when <unk> organized websites or other kinds of things that can make these things available .
imagination is more <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close to a , and also , to give designers to get to new solutions , and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and and in that sense , thank you very much for your attention and and in this spirit .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re being a child as a child , as baby , is that they care about what they do is they like , yes ? and depending on whether their parents have given them to play more or less , and , and the more , , and , in the way , and it &apos;s more , and , in the way , and it &apos;s more , and , in the way , and it &apos;s more , and , in the way , their curiosity , and so , and
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn .
so , all of all , these are and curious are i &apos;m actually curious , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
so i &apos;m now doing this all of these <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in terms of everything .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that &apos;s about phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day , they give up , give you about two grams of phosphorus and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
you can &apos;t have any teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus and then we get to get rid of phosphorus .
it &apos;s so that we &apos;re actually doing something that &apos;s a little bit , which is a <unk> , but not that &apos;s not that .
because all talk about energy , but no one speaks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we &apos;re going to hang up from two countries .
we only have phosphorus , and now through the <unk> world , much more uranium in the world , as much more uranium in all the time .
in the last 20 years , <unk> ton of corn <unk> were distributed in our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we assume .
it &apos;s <unk> leukemia .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , catching less car .
<unk> environment , make less waste .
<unk> environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like i would say , <unk> your child , it only leaves three times five times five times .
it &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think from the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> , our our entire earth will be in the sooner or later a <unk> .
so , to think about the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , as a thing .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> percent of the <unk> .
at the moment we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds of <unk> per hectare per hectare or on the square meter also .
this is , we lose about five five thousand times more than new .
we can naturally look at the <unk> .
and everything is , it &apos;s packaging or content .
in <unk> , for example , the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> has now .
and because we get older , that will be bigger .
that &apos;s kind of them , they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby takes about six bucks .
we could use that 10 percent reduction , but what does that do that ?
this is going to equilibrium in china in a second .
it &apos;s totally trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s an evidence of evidence that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> .
and people about the urine .
yes .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs , so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because it &apos;s a <unk> , right ?
traditionally , we think of the <unk> of the world , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and when you get the people who are the people who exist in , if you say , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re <unk> and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you &apos;re going to say a human life , you &apos;re going to go out the earth .
here &apos;s say , the more you <unk> , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
and if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants would weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could use myself as well , but in the u.s. , no one may be <unk> , in as far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian vegetarian .
that &apos;s called the ants weigh a lot more than we .
and because they work harder harder than we , and because they only live three to six months , they are in their weight , in your weight , in your weight , in your energy consumption , in your energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too , stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to be , what we really wanted to achieve , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all the earth , you can see that , for example , a program , to 20 40 , you want to be <unk> here , yes ?
you can only be <unk> if you haven &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only one .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree once ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we should be waking up to be a time , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
thankfully , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the <unk> .
now , you &apos;ve heard about a little bit of <unk> from trees ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be a <unk> .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the <unk> <unk> , agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own <unk> go back .
and every year we &apos;re going to go back to the three million tons of phosphorus that are really going to go back to the loops .
and so we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re feeling is so guilty of the earth that we say , there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as they &apos;re saying , the <unk> that allow our own <unk> go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we try to try to try to try to try and try to try and it &apos;s about a great footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , the tallest thing that &apos;s not there , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if they &apos;re not there .
even if you &apos;d shoot , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can do it differently .
we can get our diet back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in the field where we get the nutrients .
we can actually be able to put nutrients into this kind of way nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste of it .
in china , a <unk> of a <unk> today , like , , you know ?
and in our western world , we were still too stupid , our diet <unk> .
this is called the whole western <unk> of the , which is the city has been only taken , but the farmers never returned to .
and so , by the way , the cities had to grow more , because the farmers had to go to cities and the cities had to keep their own nutrients .
all of all the western empires are still expanding , until they haven &apos;t been able to get the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a <unk> civilization of five thousand years because you &apos;re able to <unk> the nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to food , you &apos;re expecting to eat for the food that they &apos;re going to be as long as they &apos;re going to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , go to the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see the internet , how to get the nutrients .
and this is actually a beautiful thing , if you do that , it &apos;s power , on a hectare of country with five thousand people in favelas , can provide a farmer for a <unk> dollar , and the plant for them , chickens and and herbs and herbs and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and
and the great thing is that the <unk> in the favelas to go back to the favelas .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people to control very little bad .
we can support them , good .
this is , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the <unk> is safe water .
and they &apos;re designed to design through the design that a farmer can easily .
that means that the <unk> go back .
and none of these plants , we &apos;ve been built over <unk> over the last 20 years , none of these plants have ever been <unk> .
you could easily get a gallons of <unk> , and then it would be ruined for years .
there &apos;s not going to be happening .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people , just to be bad .
we can support them , good .
that means we have to phosphorus phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do , they write in germany , in the best treatment of all the treatment treatment is in <unk> .
unfortunately , not in <unk> , but maybe they can help the <unk> , you know , they &apos;re going to help .
because the <unk> plant , the best would be the phosphorus .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we see this is that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it &apos;s going to be able to do .
we &apos;ve been used for three years in the world now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus <unk> .
but we need the overall overall .
you know , there are two countries that are almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries , 40 percent of the control control .
and the oil is we &apos;re going to replace by other energy .
but the phosphorus is not replace you .
it &apos;s not about the existing one less bad to do , but it &apos;s about to make something right .
and it &apos;s particularly first to ask questions what the right thing is .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in fact , in the netherlands , you &apos;re going to understand that because in holland is the land on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , your wife &apos;s sad sad , if you have them , and they come to 50 &apos;s roses .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s very , very effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany , about six <unk> three kilograms during their lives .
that &apos;s what it .
this isn &apos;t not exactly exactly right because because we don &apos;t know how much more <unk> is going to do .
but a <unk> , even in this illumination , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very well , in fact , yes ?
one of all , which is beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not in resource efficiency , but efficiency .
so , what &apos;s the right ?
not the <unk> of the <unk> turn a little bit better and <unk> and <unk> all the materials to the loops , but first , how do you include loops loops ?
imagine mozart efficiently .
yes ?
if i &apos;m dinner , and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful is not efficient .
if you fall in love in love , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means , everything that matters in life is not to avoid to avoid .
the whole <unk> .
we say people , oh , yeah , you don &apos;t have green green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just easy , it &apos;s just right , right ?
every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , you know , you can get back to <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
we think about north .
there &apos;s every footprint there is <unk> .
if you walk , yeah , every footprint , every footprint .
because the soil will die from the mosses , and the wind and water is water that water is water .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint , every footprint , that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a large footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we &apos;re saying in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you do with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainably .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so , not saving , smoke , avoid .
everyone &apos;s <unk> .
and it &apos;s a sense of , if you see in italy , like the people in italy , like this , &quot; <unk> can come out of the car , and it &apos;s like that .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please beautiful .
we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , for example , that is a fluid at room .
they can <unk> them , where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building around .
and they contain seeds of rare plants so that it smells away from biodiversity to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two loops .
not everything should be <unk> .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them .
just the things that are <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the way that they have to be in biological systems .
the things that are only used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
so direct advertising , and it &apos;s not for the company <unk> per se , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products .
because we don &apos;t do it all the things anymore .
yes ?
so , when i &apos;m eating it , and say , this is free of <unk> , then helps you nothing .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so , not like <unk> .
not toxic inside .
it &apos;s all in it , is useful .
these are the first ones , which you can <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and can go into the <unk> of <unk> loops , right ?
it &apos;s all about it .
and if we manage , it &apos;s natural , of course , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and the whole textile industry with .
and this is half the world &apos;s population of all the world &apos;s industry that are caused by the textile industry .
so , they &apos;re helping you ask asking people ask .
hey , <unk> , do you really really seriously ?
because now , you &apos;ve got twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure whether they really <unk> .
so , help me a little bit about it .
but it goes .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
this is going .
we can now make things like this , if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see them in biological cycles .
technical loops is just as much .
there &apos;s a direct <unk> of this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , it &apos;s to go back into the cycle .
so , so that &apos;s in every store you can <unk> the things .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> of the earth &apos;s the <unk> ?
now , when the waste is waste .
all over the <unk> , this <unk> .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the <unk> line , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , they can just go back to <unk> , and then you can plant them with a baby in israel or tunisia , <unk> trees .
yes ?
if you take these these <unk> , they sterilized , and they &apos;re going to take the powder to plant the trees .
so the baby &apos;s <unk> for life , it &apos;s already beginning to the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , like .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can still reinventing everything .
i started to a institute .
but in fact , many people are working with , and they can all get involved .
there &apos;s a extra way to get <unk> , where everybody can be involved .
so no longer saving , avoid , not , but not a <unk> , but intelligent waste .
do you make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of the <unk> .
music is a language .
now , in the face of my speech , i wrote that as a <unk> , i think , as a <unk> , in english <unk> .
<unk> is the translator &apos;s translator &apos;s written grades in <unk> music .
you don &apos;t just know as a translator &apos;s not just word for word in another language , but also the deeper sense of the words and <unk> , so it needs to make a good translation , it would make it a good translation , everybody who has to do with <unk> .
it &apos;s already in english to translate english to english , and it can &apos;t take it because if you &apos;re at poetry or poetry , at least at poetry .
but from course , from <unk> , it &apos;s what we do with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i first was the written notes .
you know , you know that the composer in the notes has exactly the <unk> of what he imagined .
in fact , the grades are very vague and <unk> .
so these notes are like just exactly the same or <unk> , like a verbal , as a very seemingly <unk> , the description of a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of the flowers is the smell of the flowers , the level of the <unk> , to see the <unk> of the <unk> doesn &apos;t feel too .
this is , the role of the role has to be the <unk> data of the <unk> in another , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to translate musically , so <unk> , even in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of the translation .
so i &apos;m going to do it , i &apos;m going to do it all of the german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be synonymous with me with translation of translation translation .
so , the music works for me as similar language .
the <unk> notes have the the phrase in the letters of the typeface .
so it &apos;s not going to take out grades and they &apos;ll give the keys on the piano or the right place to push the right place .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to do .
the point of the letters is when you can see the language to it .
and so you need to use for the process of music , at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also the way that it &apos;s also <unk> whether you &apos;re learning it for the <unk> , you can also understand , or you can speak to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> begins the same way of the <unk> .
after you first chosen a piece of being , because you &apos;re excited about , you &apos;re looking at the backgrounds of the creation of the composition .
you get information about the piece of the play .
you read the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s the words of the composer itself .
you study the works that he had before and after after that .
you tie comparison .
the <unk> , writing it .
how did he felt ?
how were his circumstances , like the society and politics ?
i &apos;m all interested in .
you think in this time , you &apos;re reading about contemporary images or literature .
but with time , you have a role of the time , the composer , and it gets easier to be more and easier to feel it in him and feel .
but the composer is always going to be more for a friend that you live together .
so , his cause to write the piece , always gets more and more to my personal cause to play it .
so , since the notes is a <unk> record of the notion of composer , but only a framework , i &apos;m turning this framework to make it and meaning to <unk> .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , what was written between this framework .
i &apos;m playing <unk> , which these sounds might have .
now for me and for the composer , and what they might mean for him today .
so , any tone gets a sense of this to make sense because i feel it even in my now , is <unk> .
it needs to be here for me in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to convince my audience .
it &apos;s always a happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve done as long as a long way to experience .
how you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , getting up , eat , eating their own , and i &apos;ll be the same thing again and again .
i &apos;ve got older again , and the seasons change , my pulse goes down to slow down , and it &apos;s longer a <unk> , it &apos;s longer than to come back home .
i take the breath of the audience , it consciously or subconsciously .
all of this influenced me and all that affected my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s a wonderful thing , even when i stand with a <unk> on stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens to be a good , <unk> conversation .
you get a new idea in and i immediately , it answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we don &apos;t have to have any way to do and what you can &apos;t get .
it makes great fun to make music , and you have the audience to have experienced music communicates alive .
this is every concert every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as much as 20 years ago .
i &apos;m going to be more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to be more <unk> , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
i have a nice thing to do this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> , in my loved school , professor <unk> <unk> , a known <unk> , <unk> and a long professor of the <unk> in <unk> .
sadly , i was too young too young , so he was already <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune to meet it very early , with 13 years , and i was so i was in school on his classes .
i was at the age 17 , when i was sitting on one of a sabbatical , and i was playing the last of the four <unk> of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what the preamble that was this <unk> .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he &apos;s got to <unk> , and he said , so ?
it &apos;s got to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already about <unk> .
well , with 17 17 , you haven &apos;t have dreams , but not major memories .
i &apos;m going to play this back and over the course of all the time , and it &apos;s been very , even though not a single note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because i i read something new .
one of a different domain of this , bloggers made the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , in light light .
he &apos;s <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , as he saw it , so as she looked at this moment .
his personal <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
but now , i &apos;ve been also older than the chopin with <unk> years ago when he wrote the piece .
he lived only for the only day for the years .
and it &apos;s important to me , and again , to look at the notes , even though i &apos;m my way to memorize them .
to keep <unk> , right with classical composer .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you begin to speak the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to have a long way for the spoken .
often the <unk> is , you know , you &apos;re learning the grades .
you can basically learn to read this , before you &apos;re just talking about a word .
you learn to find the pitches on the table on the instrument .
and then , if you &apos;re all the fingers in time and you can move the notes , then there &apos;s sound like this sounds like like music .
and if this is all this happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s barely spoken about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s good , there &apos;s a quick piece of <unk> , that &apos;s a quick piece .
<unk> , slowly .
it &apos;s like , and <unk> and b , et .
that &apos;s what most of you are here .
but also , when you put these data , it &apos;s still something technical .
and still it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder , you &apos;re often forget about a lot of <unk> .
that is that , to make music on the instrument , to do your musical and feel about it to be there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that didn &apos;t learn to sing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it .
it &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to get its own experiences and idea of music , to give it over another possibility , so about an instrument , to sound .
people who never sang the way , and they never felt directly with your own body , like it &apos;s to form a sound .
and we can make a phrase with his own breath .
the music music is the extension of our body .
so we sing our vocal party to the singing , our hands and feet to dance .
this is the <unk> in the piano , my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> , these days , there is no <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make music to make music if it becomes a boring .
no longer , to be a <unk> , or singing .
every single music is going to be , when you &apos;re going to be <unk> on the outside of music .
so , you know , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i couldn &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both it , it &apos;s not too late to start trying to find out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to get these little muscle that <unk> the vocal vocal , right .
and that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve got them <unk> you &apos;re <unk> .
so , i wonder how <unk> competent , was this diagnosis ?
have you have a <unk> or <unk> , how to say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , they don &apos;t like music and want to have no music and want to have no .
but what i would do is regret because music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can also even more <unk> .
well , you see , all there &apos;s no one to be a candidate candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand , i don &apos;t understand classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m like , but sure you can tell you whether they like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling you , i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , except because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to give it down classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them and say whether they tastes or not .
whether the music is to you too <unk> or sweet .
tell what they feel .
and then you get a lot of spices , and they want to get some spices , or taste , and you can even taste fine .
so , why am i am now to listen from my audience now , to listen to it ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate with it .
a piece of artwork you never look at it has no power .
the food that &apos;s made of a chef or a chef , you need to eat and not just looked at or recipes .
so , you hear when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
when in a environment , where adults are active , or at least active music , a child grows , a child grows , it &apos;s very easy for a <unk> , to ask , what color does your flower ?
can you play in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of the red one now is a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and this was the first of a very simple musical expression .
so the first step is to take a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of this , which is a little bit about a hundred , or even three hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have been <unk> .
there was no piano to the time of the instrument .
it wasn &apos;t just yet yet .
i think that it would be enthusiastic if he had the <unk> opportunity to the modern <unk> .
i can now the <unk> that has had the stream , on the modern wing , which is a <unk> <unk> .
also by beethoven , you know that he was hearing more than he was deaf .
today , today &apos;s modern orchestra in the position to play everything that a <unk> has rejected .
and so the composer on us rely on us <unk> to reinvent the pieces .
so it &apos;s going to be a set of the , which they &apos;ve been in the mind .
and also , what you would think about this in mind today .
or what i &apos;m today about today , because what they might have thought they could .
thank you .
you know what your envy is ?
did they have been jealous of <unk> ?
and how did that feel like ?
suck .
i have a friend , who drives a <unk> .
when i come from , with my little <unk> , <unk> <unk> and i got to get the feeling of it , i feel this feeling .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what needs you need the n of the car ?
that &apos;s the first year , the first year of his value .
and at all , you do much less than i .
why do i have to afford the n little car ?
and then i immediately , that &apos;s a problem .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is .
so our organism has invented a great technique to get these unpleasant emotions as envy to disappear .
you can also try it as words as revenge or <unk> or something like that .
i want to give you something with this mechanism or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but remember the lie , you may have heard you , if people say , nobody has a wall of the intention of building the world .
and then rocks <unk> , so he &apos;s the way to tell you the point of view .
one of these <unk> is they see the liars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check out that it &apos;s very different in the sense .
it &apos;s just simply , it &apos;s not just , and it &apos;s not .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , who have to be <unk> .
they need this lie , to get a <unk> to get a <unk> .
they can get less easily , yes , or to get down to the country .
they need time .
from this time , an anecdote that you may know .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman .
this woman was <unk> , the portrait was not going to see her .
picasso : wait just waiting .
it will be more like it .
and in this point , when you laugh , you realize how important that lie and how much time you need to learn something to learn something that artists can tell very well .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
artist &apos;s artists shares something with , and particularly this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see if you look just in the mirror .
artists , you know , in a portrait of something that you &apos;re looking at this artwork as you can still look at this work .
then , then this awkward , feeling that uncomfortable , it may not be like you , and it will be more like it .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to the <unk> of our <unk> .
and not only in the art , also in the <unk> , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , again , again .
you may know this idea of the lady that would looked at the mirror every morning , and i asked him who &apos;s the beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror , there &apos;s a <unk> one day .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and you also know how much hostility of this means , the mirror , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that truly diffuse .
but we should just be familiar with it , that you can &apos;t tell a woman , it &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing is to understand what we &apos;re seeing under <unk> <unk> .
we need this one that this lie that this is that <unk> that we can &apos;t even survive .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art , but also in science that &apos;s the science of great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s <unk> from <unk> .
she heard from this book by charles darwin , the origin of species and the descent of the people .
that human man should be <unk> , and , yes , at least a common ancestors there were between people and monkeys .
and then she <unk> her to her husband and said , that &apos;s not true what charles da .
the human being supposed to be the monkeys <unk> or a common ancestors .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent people to figure out of that .
why have to prevent people to know , people know , what if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live that <unk> without these <unk> .
because we &apos;re doing this <unk> , this feeling of great , the <unk> of the highest creature , not from one of these <unk> , from something like an organism that exists in a stone , and whatever things that is for us .
so , we can &apos;t have these things at all .
we have to prevent people to know , people know , everything , when they are true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanisms look out and how the trace looks like , leaving the way that &apos;s on this great picture of ourselves , and i want to see you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
a <unk> student .
it likes to him special because he &apos;s a <unk> to sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire brigade .
and because i &apos;m in the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral justify the <unk> because it &apos;s used to be able to replace it by the <unk> of the time .
do it once , and then you &apos;ll find the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind the inform .
so a little <unk> , they &apos;re not interested in <unk> .
the interest in the <unk> .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look around , and we can look around , how to do fire .
there &apos;s just the second second second , the fire brigade .
there it signed up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say , he &apos;s also , you like to put it somewhere and get excited when the fire after <unk> .
no , it &apos;s just a lot better , if we show that we are in charge of the risks that the other people can only do , when they put fire fire .
here they have this little mechanism .
these <unk> that <unk> that in the <unk> of the <unk> , he knew that he was related to the fire , but he can &apos;t tell it .
here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious of mind , immediately , without that they can do something about it , and the things that you know they &apos;re very different , and the things you know they can &apos;t be a lot better for them and others .
so , just like this words that we have to use the language of the politically <unk> speech .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know , if we say that , the social sounds are very sensitive to the social .
we can &apos;t just do it easy .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to do things like this , to be presenting .
so i want to share with you a phrase that we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic this deception , these <unk> , the willingness , another reality than the ones we &apos;ve already know in the unconscious of the unconscious , it &apos;s the validity to spread out .
this is two , maybe to this , maybe three examples .
the first example of the , what many of you know , and some of you , very few of you , very few of you , very few .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is so important , say , leibniz &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop <unk> , physical nature .
and when you have people who have a permanent belief , you know , you have a soul , or you can also say that you have been the soul to live , you know , that &apos;s what the soul has been so about , and it &apos;s like the soul that a <unk> framework .
and by that soul , you think that somehow somehow in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , it &apos;s in latin , the <unk> , mind .
and when this <unk> <unk> then , you know about the people , it &apos;s filled with , with nature , which only live , and with the soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so , it &apos;s supposed to be coming from the outside to people .
so we should sense of as something that &apos;s really important to your life .
and if you have this principal , you then understand the logic , which we can see this happiness , through a <unk> , our world can improve .
because now you can apply it to a <unk> .
<unk> , you know , they &apos;re from school .
now this is a <unk> here here , which is a logic .
this is the hardest part of the talk in my talk .
here you need a logic , but the willingness to lie .
and that &apos;s how to lie , they can just be able to use this logic .
in this <unk> , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second set is , when the <unk> right , he &apos;s got a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;m very closely here .
and a third set of immediately , in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
the ones who say who &apos;s not a soul , who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it &apos;s already .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logically .
i can argue everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell the reality about reality .
i can say , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s true .
i can argue everything .
but the key thing is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , when he &apos;s right , he &apos;s got a soul .
these things are logically .
and now our consciousness feels like our consciousness immediately , and it can make something .
it &apos;s a third set of which nothing has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and provided .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , it &apos;s just to make two sentences , and a third <unk> , that looks like this , and it &apos;s like to do something that it &apos;s like to do something that we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing this , it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example , which is the same time again .
and this is another <unk> topic , a <unk> of philosophy , mind .
so this is what we have to do with this is that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars that was johannes <unk> and after that &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is inherently natural nature .
it doesn &apos;t have the soul .
this is a <unk> .
and if you put it right in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he &apos;s <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack should go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so , the <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> problems .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so only if you get another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a haystack a haystack , it doesn &apos;t have reason , and nothing else .
and it &apos;s going automatically , he &apos;s going to roll up the right idea .
so , if you have this idea , you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger piles that wear a immediately immediately , you have the feeling that it needs to be like a free .
and if we &apos;re already in <unk> , and then , i remember the <unk> of <unk> .
there &apos;s a scholars that says wolf , and he says , &quot; you say , wolf , the wolf said , there &apos;s no <unk> .
now we can form the second set of the second sentence , and you say , if wolf &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have any <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logically and correct .
and what we &apos;re going to read about daily in daily daily , and you find that third sentence .
it looks like this , the way that no <unk> has no <unk> , and claims , they can be pulled into responsibility , and he &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , they have again .
actually , you have to be able to prove whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do as the first sentence wrong , as you would have to take the opposite of the opposite of the world .
and now you can just easy , if you want to do something like anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , they want to practice this courage to lie .
practice for example , if you meet a person , you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please , don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , that means the prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little more politically <unk> .
say , there &apos;s no <unk> .
immediately , you will find one , for granted that &apos;s , of course , you know , that can &apos;t prove you .
and already , they have a problem .
because while they &apos;re engaged in it , they &apos;re not able to prove that they &apos;re not able to prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man &apos;s happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s misled .
because he led them to a <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t even even too .
because it &apos;s actually not interested in this human being in this human .
he &apos;s just interested in the <unk> of the need to prove to prove that there &apos;s been <unk> .
so , in the way of the <unk> shift the <unk> , you experience the brilliance of the lie .
and if you have a way of a way to feel that <unk> , you do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy to be happy , if they remember this way to remember this way .
thank you for your attention .
yes , good afternoon .
i i have asked me to have a question of my question , whether i &apos;m going to say you .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here here from this great event , and i asked me whether i keep there a lecture and i think my idea .
i &apos;m going to say to be honest , you &apos;ve got it to me , it was difficult to talk about my idea .
and i may may be able to imagine my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but it &apos;s natural , of course , the sum is all very , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably one of the , are the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that made for this bad <unk> image , because i &apos;ve started to study engineering centers in <unk> , technological education , i think , &quot; i think kit .
and i got it in the middle of the <unk> , <unk> , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
because then the were the <unk> , the <unk> was called <unk> .
the real thing today is today .
because a good engineer has either made a lot of cars or <unk> .
but it &apos;s like the n <unk> , from this kind of hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , it was a crazy <unk> .
i &apos;m the <unk> grateful that he had the word again again , because after the <unk> , you &apos;d have to use the word at all , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the <unk> .
there was it that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them sitting in <unk> in the <unk> , where you suspected doing it .
and it was the place of the <unk> , but it was <unk> and <unk> and solar power and i started in the <unk> .
and yes , a lot of what i said , i was going to be very , because many , many beautiful expressions of the ones that i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve been 11 years in the collective of the collective , that was <unk> .
we were 20 people .
if one was no , the <unk> , it &apos;s got a totally <unk> . i &apos;ve got a long years to be able to <unk> if i really have my great <unk> , i think , i think my great <unk> , and i think , you have the money to the windows .
it &apos;s about insanity .
and this was really very , very , very , very , and you put it into this kind of thing , just showed up a picture of a <unk> , where i asked me about 10 years , a thousand <unk> , and the of course , is that this is what it &apos;s really the great thing .
and i then put it up to <unk> , and then we have to friends with friends , and then the <unk> <unk> , the most largest <unk> of the world .
a <unk> , but we &apos;ve got to get back to the problem of a growing company , and we then have <unk> , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to go and go back and go back and and i think that &apos;s what i think , is , and i think of course , it &apos;s a little bit crazy , and i think , and i think of course , it &apos;s just crazy , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and so i brought you a project i &apos;m going to now now .
and the title of the talk was , you know , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively <unk> story , where could you be using a memory of it today .
on this island , this is the island of the island of the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are a four and a half thousand people .
they have today to be a positive <unk> of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not the technological .
if you <unk> more <unk> , the system begins to fail .
i &apos;m going to tell you the politicians , and when they <unk> our equipment in <unk> .
they always say , why ?
we have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent and our net is the the european space , the european .
if we had seven percent of the same problems we have already got the same problems that people have in this island .
the question was just , the first thing was <unk> , the first page of the island , we don &apos;t expect any time .
how big , it would have to be a battery so that you &apos;re like to 20 , 30 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again a <unk> .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a year , about 100 <unk> electrical performance on the world .
it &apos;s the conversion of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world is going on diesel , because you don &apos;t have a failure .
this is fast .
you put it a box .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
and they &apos;re always going to run three of the <unk> , two are always waiting for .
yes , this is the bottom of the bottom is the load .
we also have very detailed data .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is the rule of a <unk> system , or a system , which is only in small quantities here .
and our goal was just to say , okay .
diesel is going to be <unk> and the wind , sun will exploit the load of the load of the larger amount .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent of renewable energy , so energy per year , you have to get the performance on the .
that means , in the moment , they have to worry about how to take the entire net .
and that &apos;s , of course , if you &apos;re going to have a way in some way , and they have managed to get a way .
that &apos;s one one that no one has done this one .
so that &apos;s in a small scale , so you can also feed your <unk> over a little <unk> .
people always ask me what do you do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to go through and get through these <unk> of these <unk> , and they &apos;re supposed to build a net , it will be very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to get to all three percent renewable , and then there &apos;s another rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive and it doesn &apos;t work that it &apos;s going to be very , very expensive and it doesn &apos;t work that it &apos;s going to work , and it doesn &apos;t work that it &apos;s going to work , and it doesn &apos;t work that it &apos;s going to work , and it doesn &apos;t work that
it &apos;s going to be a energy in the case , it &apos;s a energy , hydrogen , <unk> , power to gas , it or sh , it will be then .
they then have to go to a <unk> and <unk> and not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , <unk> battery battery .
how far you get there ?
and then you have a whole bunch of simulation .
and have wind and sun and the load and the load , and the result , a very interesting outcome that you need a <unk> of the conventional system that &apos;s about 50 cents a <unk> per <unk> , about 50 cents a <unk> .
this was the first calculations of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business plan .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the <unk> five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiating the <unk> .
what would have to be done ?
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new research .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do it even 20 percent of diesel , and they &apos;re not <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> that the <unk> is on the island , it &apos;s what we find great .
but let &apos;s support , but we don &apos;t believe that the technical problem can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , in the way we can actually map the electrical impact on the island of the ocean .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s naturally coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , the <unk> , today , <unk> , and then became <unk> to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a dollar performance , and it can bring it six hours long hours , and that &apos;s the battery we &apos;ve got to have <unk> <unk> .
and then they set them .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as he &apos;s there , in the hall , in fact , the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in this hall , it &apos;s now , because the <unk> stands up here , this is the big battery here , here &apos;s the entire battery , here &apos;s the entire <unk> that we simulate the web .
and here we have simulate the whole <unk> , the <unk> of the cable , to set the <unk> on the web .
and here you can see it again .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see this again , we &apos;ll see this diesel again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again ,
and what we did was since the <unk> of the time , it &apos;s all done , until today , the <unk> of the building of electronics , in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of battery and the theme of the net and everything in between them .
you have to communicate to battery , you have to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
and the beauty is on the theme that you &apos;re basically taken on this island today , the <unk> of the problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our energies of renewable renewables .
so this whole discussion , how is going to go back to the moment , <unk> , like this , we have to <unk> for <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is then <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> everywhere .
we can start in the island already , to integrate <unk> , you can manage the load .
that means , if you &apos;re about 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can <unk> through the n , you can get nets , yes , that &apos;s supposed to be the amount of <unk> , but you can never get to feed on memory .
and that &apos;s the n of the message .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what you &apos;re going to get .
if we turn the diesel , you haven &apos;t just get more this spinning mass that causes a little more inertia on the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just <unk> masses of big <unk> , where the wave is all around the wave around europe .
we look at this web , and see the 50 hertz , and when it gets nine to <unk> nine hertz , we start a few <unk> <unk> , then we get a few <unk> <unk> , then again , again , a little bit more <unk> , and then we come back again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you zoom in it somewhere , it &apos;s a time .
the <unk> reserves has at least 10 seconds to hold the net stable .
and in time , they can react to other other .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , then you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> this big battery two milliseconds of a milliseconds .
there you see , there &apos;s enormous <unk> there .
and the message is now , we have to get on this rotating masses , if we &apos;re like to be our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , thirty , thirty percent and so on , if we want to reach the first .
then we have to break our <unk> capacity in the net .
<unk> is just the power station is going to do it to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> moment in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because it &apos;s not .
and we simply try to make it to make the capacity , the capacity of the capacity , you can put into electrochemical storage into the net .
so , fortunately , there are also a lot of studies .
and to that purpose , people are always going to come and look at our <unk> , in the way of our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion goes over to the question , how far can you get a little bit of future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
don &apos;t , there &apos;s insanity , <unk> , we &apos;ve never been made .
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just just just going to get the same , we &apos;re going to be the same capacity to the the next hundred years , and they &apos;re going to have the same capacity to be store in the world .
it &apos;s just easy , it will come .
there &apos;s a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
and the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists are looking at my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million <unk> now , and we have a <unk> now to <unk> the year of the <unk> .
this is going to be a place in the next april .
so , by so , you also also also aware that there &apos;s a change , and it &apos;s only from this <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent of renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
so far , in discussions , they &apos;re trying to get these <unk> , which have a little net net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
the question is very simple , if they &apos;re completely independently , or <unk> <unk> , who are going to be <unk> somewhere in the world , and they &apos;re going to get them to them , you &apos;re an island .
then they only consume that , which is the sun and wind there is where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> power , and i &apos;m also grateful that they &apos;re told , solar power .
and this is what we do , and that &apos;s the talk of <unk> <unk> , that you can be able to use a collective and solar power , a little bit together .
and yes , i want to encourage you to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet and a vision .
and you really have to remain pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , <unk> , los angeles times , one day through the streets in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who was on a violin , just two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles , this was a book that was called <unk> , with robert <unk> junior junior , steve lopez and jamie <unk> as a <unk> , and a very career , <unk> and his <unk> <unk> was finished by his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel was a <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived the chicago in the streets of <unk> row at the center of los angeles .
i recommend you to read the <unk> book , or to look at the film , so they &apos;re not only understanding the wonderful connection , and the one of these two men came up with these two men , but also how the music is made , but how the music is it , and how it &apos;s the , if it &apos;s the instrument , it &apos;s the <unk> , <unk> , nathaniel &apos;s going to make the <unk> , <unk> away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just heard a piece of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony and came backstage to imagine .
he talked to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and how the dodgers never create in the <unk> world , and it all the <unk> passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to the subject to speak music , and a few days later i got an e-mail , in the stood that was that <unk> was interested in <unk> for me .
i have to mention that nbc was a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electrical and handcuffed , a trauma that has his whole life .
and as a result , it &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears days , in the streets of <unk> row , always that horror and the <unk> of his own spirit .
and in exactly the way , a <unk> , nathaniel was nathaniel when we started walt to the first class of walt disney hall , and he had this <unk> <unk> <unk> in his eyes and didn &apos;t have lost it .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how to poison somebody in sleep .
i was scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him in one of his arms , and i was able to break him his relationship with a violin , and i started talking about scale and and other and other kinds of exciting shapes of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in <unk> eyes , there was a total change in <unk> .
it was like he was under the impact of a bad drug , a chemical reaction , a chemical reaction was my game .
<unk> <unk> anger , in understanding , a quiet curiosity and <unk> .
and as he took his cape and started to play some of the snippets of snippets of <unk> , and asked me to to finish , and they would be like to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so we started talking about music , started to speak about it , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that he had not only a <unk> knowledge of music , but it also with her own own personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i &apos;d like to just be in the <unk> of los angeles .
using music playing music and talked about music , a <unk> man , who was running on the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for a <unk> , music is emotional health .
because the music allows him to him , and delusions of his own imagination and and creativity into something real .
and so he <unk> his <unk> states .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and this is why we make music , so we &apos;re in the inside of us , in the inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens through our creativity , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression comes to us all , and move , inspired and united us .
what nathaniel did , so it brought the music back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought back to the family of musicians who recognized him his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to talk to nathaniel <unk> , whether if there was walt disney <unk> hall or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
daddy <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen the <unk> .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i know a lot of the same time in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a kind of <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> of the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was bred to the <unk> standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like to sell it to it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked , if i could be a <unk> at a little clip about the sustainability of a farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
so here &apos;s a company that was trying to solve this tremendous problem for our chefs , how do we keep doing fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years we have the oceans in the last 50 years we have been beaten .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , <unk> , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , or <unk> , <unk> , part of our future .
many of the case against it . <unk> <unk> the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we &apos;re taking tuna . a massive disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of <unk> are required for you to get a pounds of output .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t it tastes very well .
so here &apos;s finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
so on the day before i said , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow as far out in sea , that their environment is not covered . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world &apos;s a world .
this <unk> <unk> came to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one what ? what feeds you ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; the &quot; <unk> , &quot; he said .
&quot; great &quot; i said . i put on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a protein ?
so i called the next day , before the event , don &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know it . he &apos;s going to take .
well , i &apos;m going to have a couple of people in the company . no one could give me the answer , until i finally <unk> the oldest biologists .
let &apos;s call him &quot; don &apos;t .
&quot; don &quot; , &quot; what are the natural proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned a few algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food is processed . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your body is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t know what &apos;s sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long time in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
i &apos;m even that .
no , i actually have <unk> <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after that entertainment did .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic species , the way you you know , you know , you know your fish , you love the fish .
i ate it first in a restaurant for a restaurant .
a <unk> journalist had been talking for a long time of this fish .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> us .
he came down on the table with a light , almost <unk> white ink .
the chef had him .
hold twice .
but amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well , after he got <unk> ?
i can &apos;t it , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it <unk> . it &apos;s actually called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t have a fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way you and i understand them .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of the .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the <unk> of <unk> .
they raised <unk> on what they were basically wetlands .
they made it by the country to <unk> .
they built these complicated and <unk> , and they <unk> water from the country and beyond the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it , not economic .
and green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to see what to be a lot of birds .
and so , in 1982 , a spanish company , which was bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water in the other hand .
they literally have the levers of the levers .
instead of using water water , they used the channels of water , and then water was <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a $ <unk> of <unk> -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company , the ecological destruction entirely vice versa .
the farm is unbelievable .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time there to be a long time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a croc to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were fighting and fighting with the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees and <unk> <unk> into <unk> .
here he lifts a rare <unk> <unk> .
now it &apos;s mentioning the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of bundle that it reminds him into the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of its career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how he &apos;s become such a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i know nothing about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on the relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and <unk> , in more <unk> of rare birds and algae and odd <unk> .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community of <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak over this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had to the <unk> .
so i was going to him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s unbelievable .
but what are your food ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he goes to tell me that this is a rich system that the fish eat the fish , which they would eat in the wild .
the plants , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of a farm belongs to their animals are not feeding their animals ?
later , i was driving on this site , i was going around with <unk> , and i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
and at the moment it was like a film that would have a <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner , and we have the incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker pinker , are literally enough to the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , there were <unk> <unk> , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one of the most important private development today in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> <unk> , not the last one that you want to have to have a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
so the <unk> , they eat the phytoplankton .
so the the nature of the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink it . a farm that doesn &apos;t take their animals and a farm that is measuring their success on the health of their predators .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> <unk> of the first first ever ever be there .
they breed in a city of <unk> away where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning , they fly 240 <unk> .
and every night , you &apos;ll fly down to 240 .
they do it because they can follow the <unk> white line of the <unk> .
seriously .
i was suggested to the kind of my penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly to be 240 miles away from the farm and fly it up at <unk> at the evening ?
do it for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as i was quoted , i was quoted .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention my loved my loved , and i mentioned , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i &apos;m not cooking .
and yet , when i try it in that restaurant , you didn &apos;t have dreamed of <unk> .
she tasted sweet and it &apos;s in as if you take a bite off the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense of the before something to get into the body .
it &apos;s developed in evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that is their success measures the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , because it &apos;s massive , because the water is flowing through this farm from the flow of <unk> .
it &apos;s a stream that has all the things that are , are rivers that are rivers that are rivers that are , they have chemical pollutants , from <unk> .
and when it was fought through the system , and this is the water cleaner than how it &apos;s <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it &apos;s just for you and i.
because if the water weathers , it &apos;s <unk> in the atlantic .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and you should do it , because this love love , as romantic as always as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one of them in foods .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit to radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food , we eat organic food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that are good to ensure the future of the food , someone somewhere in and says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re having enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed the world .
a billion people are hungry today .
a billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our <unk> over the last 50 years .
we feed corn corn , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken , and all the time has the whole time , &quot; if we &apos;re more people , how awful can it be , like , it &apos;s ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was the place . it was the business business business business .
we should call them what they &apos;re , a craft in <unk> , a industry that allows <unk> capital of the <unk> , which allows for this production .
it &apos;s not the craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main is now threat today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of the <unk> resources .
not through the latest <unk> and <unk> , but by canada , not by pumps , but through clean water , not by <unk> , but through forest , and not through <unk> and nets , but through fish , but through fish .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that have to have any community to feed themselves ?
to do that , look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are <unk> and it never made something really good for food .
let &apos;s take instead of the ecological model .
this is that for two billion years of <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
companies , who are not worlds for themselves , businesses , which are working , like <unk> , businesses , the <unk> of food instead of just intense , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships , but we &apos;re talking about relationships .
because they are the ones who are also flavor for flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better <unk> than i ever will .
you know , this is right , because when the future is good food , it becomes delicious .
thank you .
if i want to see you one thing today is that the sum of data we consume , greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about <unk> , i want you to think about how we can look at how we can see information , and we see how we see information that would otherwise haven &apos;t seem to be seen .
so , what we see here is a typical <unk> at age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter for a particular cause of death , we say accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> , the most active , and they &apos;re at the most active .
we can go out and line the data and see the data , and see that <unk> and cancer is the normal suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we &apos;re going on on and after age , we &apos;re seeing 40 years or a younger , we see that accidents should be concerned about the cause of the world people should worry about .
and who &apos;s <unk> , this is true in men .
so you see , you know , this is the way of information and data in this way , it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
and if we can make these for data , why not that for content itself ?
now , what we &apos;ve now have the <unk> of each single single single single single single single single single single single single single single year .
it &apos;s all there . it &apos;s all online .
you &apos;d like to test it to my talk in their <unk> .
with <unk> , they can dive into a decade .
they can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain output .
now , when i look here , i see the athlete that appear in this copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click this way , and let me show me all the time in which armstrong said .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a <unk> of the , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to a step back and <unk> the way .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of it , that if you look at this kind of information , <unk> , bigger , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t look for , you don &apos;t just look at <unk> .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want this idea now a little bit more like something like crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one , and it &apos;s reduced to a little <unk> .
and so , <unk> contains a little review and a symbol of the area that you get .
i just show up the top 500 of the world &apos;s sweeping <unk> .
but even in this in that in this , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are the popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of the government .
now after i chose the government , i know that the <unk> , who are most of the time of time , &quot; people &apos;s the time . &quot;
this is really important , there &apos;s a insight that is not in a single <unk> .
it &apos;s just to see if you look at a step back and look at this .
so , a particular , a particular clip , i can go into time to time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and everybody together .
now , when i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of these are <unk> -- some of the people come from science . some of the , they &apos;re from the economy . here is my boss . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s a ted winner .
so we can jump now jumping up and see a look at all ted winner .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the net , the first time , as if it &apos;s really a net , not just from page to side , but more more .
and so i want to give you what a little surprise you want to show .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , this exercise -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not browser , but you can see websites with this -- and we bring these <unk> to each other website like this .
so i can go back a step back to a specific <unk> jump .
so that &apos;s why , because you just look at the way from the way to look at the way of internet sites in this way , to look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in a particular course in a particular place .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration here that i kept doing this .
and i can kind of like all i &apos;ve looked at this way , again , again .
and , when i look back to a step , and i can try to new and i &apos;ll try to new <unk> , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for , here &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for , or <unk> , looking at bing , or looking at <unk> .
and from here i can come up and i &apos;m going to come back to the side .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes the sum bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment in this world , we think that &apos;s a curse .
we talk about the curse curse .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; steven &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on the head so that we &apos;re going to go from one to the other , to get many things to many things , and by introducing patterns that would be hidden hidden in the other way ?
if we can do this , this fossil <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just to move in information , we can know from that .
and if we know , if we know , we can even pull away from it .
so i &apos;m listening to that . thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
i went to the bus school , i was driving an hour every day every day .
and my nose , always kept in a book , a <unk> , which my thoughts in other worlds and also <unk> my deep in my <unk> , classic curiosity .
and so that curiosity showed up that i was always when i was not in school , and went and , and &quot; specimens , &quot; frogs , frogs and snakes and bugs and uncles and <unk> and <unk> , everything in home and watched them underneath the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it &apos;s always trying to try to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be able to see in my environment , because then in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the sea .
jacques cousteau came into his amazing shows that we have to and places and places and a world full of wonder that we &apos;ve never had ever imagined .
so , it &apos;s the very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could painting .
and there &apos;s no video games still , these <unk> video , and i had the whole images in the media environment , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all that time . if we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected it on the canvas in our heads .
and my reaction was this , and i was drawing and drawing from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and all the same thing .
i was constantly caught by the teachers , like i hid in the textbook , <unk> .
creativity had to be out of creativity .
and what happened was interesting to me , which was fascinated by jacques <unk> shows , the idea of a world &apos;s greatest world on our earth itself .
certainly , i would never reach an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed quite unlikely .
but here &apos;s a world that i could actually go into the earth , and it was just amazing as amazing and exotic as all that i was thinking i was thinking about this books .
so i decided to be 15 , as i was 15 , it was .
the only thing that was in was that i was living in a small village in canada , 3,000 kilometers from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let me frustrated .
i <unk> my father , until he finally had a <unk> in buffalo , new york , who had been given on the other side of the frontier , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the winter in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the ocean , i got only two years later on the face as we moved to california .
and then , in the 40 years , the time , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea itself is so rich in the most extreme life , as we can &apos;t really imagine .
the imaginations of nature knows no boundaries , unlike our own , <unk> human imagination .
until the days of today , i am deepest awe for what i see my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as ever .
so when i was a grown-up profession , it was the filmmaking .
it seemed the best opportunity to tell the inner , to tell the story with my need to create images with my need to create images .
as a child , i drew books and so forth .
so , films were the way to bring images and <unk> together . that adapted together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m looking at , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could connect my predilection for the <unk> and diving into the filmmaking .
so , so , in fact , my two passions are .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> &quot; : to solve a problem problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we we put on animation animation , <unk> , <unk> .
and what was came out , the first <unk> <unk> was the first <unk> of the one of the movie .
the movie didn &apos;t really put money in the same thing , just he played his pill , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was <unk> from the magic that came out of it .
we know , arthur clarke are known for law , and magic is not separate from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator , &quot; my next film , even more on .
together with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very much of the time that this effect would be .
and it worked . again , we had something magical , and the effect of the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little more money on the movie .
so from these two experiences , to go a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i started a company , with my good friend , stan <unk> who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was to start with visual printers and to skip and the same <unk> .
so we also did that , and we did a advantage of a a while we did a advantage of time .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- which we had the company , too slow down .
i had this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; &quot; which is written the shelf into visual effects and <unk> effects in the very new altitudes , with lifelike human , expressive characters who were made of <unk> , and the <unk> should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the bar hit quite beautiful . and people in my company told me that we still haven &apos;t be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship , the end .
the <unk> , i have to be &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it &apos;s been a <unk> of magnitude , a keen movie .
but secretly , i wanted to <unk> the real wreckage at the real wreckage .
so , i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i &apos;m sure by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to the wreckage . we &apos;re doing this real wreckage .
we &apos;ll show it in the <unk> of the film .
it &apos;s immensely important . it &apos;s a good marketing tool for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that , back to your own imagination can make a reality .
we then then then , in fact , six months later , a reality that i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four miles beneath the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t a film , no <unk> , it was real .
so , this really blew my mind .
and the amount of effort to be enormous . we had to put cameras and the lights and build everything .
and i noticed , like this <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> , to develop .
you go into this capsule , you &apos;re going to float into this dark , <unk> environment , where don &apos;t have hope to save , if you can &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is as i was in a <unk> .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was just obsessed with the study of the ocean .
anyway , of the part of the part of the to wonder and science , it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a humbling experience that i couldn &apos;t give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the <unk> .
and some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before and the science of the time we saw them .
so that &apos;s got to be right , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood and i &apos;m <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they were exploring with <unk> .
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and the inside of the ship , what never had been done before .
no one had the internal of the <unk> explored , and you had no tools for it , so we developed the technology technology .
well , there i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , these are quite similar to this kind of , and i know that once the tape has played there .
and i fly with a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
i mean , i think it &apos;s just like , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was still physically in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most <unk> form of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner around a corner , i knew what the same was in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to go around the <unk> of the vehicle , because i did the film .
and the set was a very <unk> copy of the design plans of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me aware that you &apos;re using such <unk> <unk> and so consciousness in the vehicle , to be able to be able to be able to look at this other shape .
it was really incredibly profound .
and maybe a little bit , a little bit , which may happen in some decades , if you have <unk> , to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
and after that expeditions , we started to know what we saw at the bottom , to be able to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with aid .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , we can do it .
and so you can see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade , they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very <unk> , and that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and the <unk> and the <unk> , and you &apos;re going to have proper <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they &apos;re going to go through , and it &apos;s going to take the <unk> of the <unk> and and we &apos;re taking our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but ultimately it was going to be able to take a <unk> to the sea .
i took them with them and <unk> them to the world , there are <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take them to the sources , so they could take them and and instruments , and they could test instruments and so on .
we did it , in fact , but we did science , and i was like <unk> .
so the circle of the circle between my existence as a child , then as a child , and the execution in the reality .
and in this discovery of discovery discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you can also lead a director , a leader , like a <unk> or something like this .
i don &apos;t mind much by leadership before i was doing this expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what comes out ? &quot;
these <unk> films don &apos;t get us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the manufacturing . from fame not .
everybody think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; <unk> and would have the nails on a set of a beach .
i &apos;ve all these films , this documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no credit , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it to be the sake of the challenge , and the ocean is the most extreme environment that you are . you &apos;re doing it because of the <unk> because of the , because of the kind of weird connection that comes from , if a small group of people are .
because we &apos;ve made all this with only 10 to 12 people working on years , and we were at two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the idea that you have before each other because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain anybody else .
when you go back to shore and says , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , and the whole thing about the , and the difficulty , the <unk> , the human <unk> , when you &apos;re working on sea , and the difficulty can &apos;t explain it . this is like policemen or in the way .
there &apos;s a connection , each other respect .
so when i was going back to my next film , &quot; avatar , trying to apply the same leadership , which is that you get his team and join the respect of respect .
and so this is what the dynamic really changed .
so , there i was again with a little <unk> of a little bit of a little bit , we did , &quot; avatar with a new technique that didn &apos;t have before .
hugely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a <unk> for a four and a half years .
and this is what my way to do my way , to make movies .
there were people who said we were actually able to travel this <unk> , and we were transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of that ?
what do we learn what lessons we learned ?
i think , first , the curiosity says .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the <unk> of your team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice to me , like i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> you yourself .
it &apos;s already going to get . don &apos;t you do yourself , you don &apos;t bet against themselves . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has this one <unk> , &quot; fail is no alternative . &quot;
but in art , and it needs to be a alternative , because there will guarantee it a <unk> .
no important effort to be the innovation demanded .
you have to be willing to take those risks on themselves .
this is the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you with the way . failure is a alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this surprised to be something , because my <unk> is mostly about vaccines and seed , to the things that we invent and deliver the poorest billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> is not growing over many years , it &apos;s too much to be too much , and things are going to change how to be able to withstand the fragile environment .
it leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to the .
so , it &apos;s going to change a matter of the climate .
and it &apos;s also very important for you .
in fact , if it &apos;s only the price of the price , to the cost of energy , it would be far far by the most effective .
well , the <unk> is like it &apos;s time .
in fact , the <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid decline in the <unk> and so we can make modern materials and do a lot of things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we cut the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- we &apos;re going to get on a new barrier and this barrier is related to co2 .
carbon warms the planets and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they <unk> the <unk> of carbon that leads to <unk> , and these <unk> has a lot of negative consequences , effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems that can &apos;t adapt such rapid outcomes and so on the whole systems collapse .
now the exact relationship between a <unk> and and it comes to the <unk> and where they follow their other consequences , there are some of them , but not very many .
and there &apos;s safe ambiguity of how bad these consequences are going to be extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; we really have to get down to zero ?
don &apos;t have a quarter or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to move .
and so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a <unk> truck , which has to be a <unk> bridge , and then you can put it in a sort of them underneath .
this is a very down to the bottom , zero .
well , we &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> , about 26 billion tons .
every americans , about 20 tons , people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of each on the planet .
and somehow we have to make change that will be down to zero .
it &apos;s so far .
only different economic changes have affected it , and we have to go from <unk> increase in a mile to zero .
this equation has four things . a little bit multiplication , you have this thing on the left -- the co2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be a zero to zero and it &apos;s going to be a lot of people , from the number of the service and the co2 that is <unk> per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s see each one factor , and we think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of these numbers are very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through .
we first have the population .
today &apos;s life today .
and it &apos;s about nine billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;ve been very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could be the 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re looking at a <unk> .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all the food that we eat , clothes , television , heat .
these are very good things and <unk> means that the services of almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could do it , and the average , it will be increasing and less than double , and on average , that number of the number of services , the number of services that have provided the number of the services .
here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s a light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy of energy , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t happen .
because of different successes of different successes , through other <unk> , through new ways , there are many services , and that can produce a single service of energy to 90 percent .
in other service , like the <unk> of <unk> , 65 of <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; / <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , it &apos;s a lot smaller for improvement .
so , in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we &apos;re probably going to get a factor three or maybe even a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe <unk> 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough to go .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- this is the amount of co2 that is going to be <unk> per unit of energy .
it turns out the question of whether you can get it to zero .
if you &apos;re coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every <unk> of electricity in these days , except renewables and <unk> .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , when i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i mean , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a wonder .
the internet and its service is a miracle .
so people have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
they don &apos;t normally have a deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
it &apos;s normally just wrong to get wrong and some people , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give up and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really deliver this ?
is it a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of the people here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitoes and somehow people like this .
the idea was really , for them , you know that there are people who are living with mosquitoes .
and for energy , this is one .
i decided that this was my <unk> &apos;s going to be my <unk> &apos;s going to the environment .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that they don &apos;t bite you . you &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of <unk> like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or a couple of a few scales that have a unimaginable of the world , and although there are many directions in people who are looking for , i really see five , really five , to do this big demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , fusion and <unk> <unk> .
they may afford a <unk> , and if you afford better than i expect , this is great , but my punchline here is that we have to be at all five work , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they scary , because they &apos;re really scary problems .
let &apos;s see if we first burning fossil fossil fuels , burning coal , natural gas .
what you have to do is just easy , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of the co2 that comes out of the car , and then , it , and then storing pressure somewhere and hope that it &apos;s there .
there are some <unk> that that &apos;s going on 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get it to 100 percent , and they &apos;re going to get a very difficult , and one that is a very difficult , but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee what literally a lot of billions of <unk> you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
it &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing .
next : <unk> .
it also has three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , the question for sure you really feel that nothing can be wrong , despite the human engagement , that fuel doesn &apos;t use for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable , and you should work on .
the last three five , i &apos;ve summarized in .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re called a lot .
and also , although it &apos;s great , although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
it &apos;s a energy density , these technologies are dramatically smaller than the <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about lots of <unk> , a thousand times more over a normal power power .
and then these sources <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be the same , and the wind is not all the time .
and so you have to get out of these sources , you have a way , the energy in times when they &apos;re not available to get it .
so there &apos;s big <unk> . there are challenges in terms of transmission , if we say that the energy source is outside of the country , it doesn &apos;t take only the technology , you have to have to deal with the risk that the energy of where is different from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , and the <unk> , computer , mobile phones , for everything , and that &apos;s what i found with the amount of electronic energy that are using the world , as it is , and i found that all the batteries that are going to use , and i found that all the batteries that are going to use , and i found that all batteries that we &apos;re doing now , as well , that all the batteries that are going to
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the possibilities at the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over the way we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to raise 100 percent on it , they need an incredible amount of railways .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
so a &quot; manhattan project ? how come to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds of .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
you &apos;ll say , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of this here in ted group , there are already engaged .
bill is a lot of companies , including a <unk> that has great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in dozens of companies that have great things and interesting opportunities and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m funding a company that &apos;s been haunted the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , it &apos;s liquid .
and the development has left in this industry in this industry , a long time , so there &apos;s no big surprise that some good concepts lying around .
the <unk> means that you &apos;re instead of a part of the <unk> , which is a percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thought about it , but you could never simulate a reasonable , but then it &apos;s modern supercomputers , you can simulate it and see that , yes , you can simulate it and see that it &apos;s like , yes .
and because you burn that 99 percent of burning , the <unk> is very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use to waste &apos;s reactors as a <unk> .
instead of going to break it , they burn it . a great thing .
and it &apos;s going to be incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a &quot; traveling of the <unk> of mud .
it really really the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s getting down today , so it &apos;s <unk> uranium .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> , you get enough propellant for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
so let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we look like this manuscript ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal we need to get to , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many are a percent of about 80 percent reduction in 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and still , agriculture . hopefully , and then it will clean and cement and then be clean .
so , to get these 80 percent , the industrialized nations , including countries like china , their <unk> change completely .
the other note says , whether we use the <unk> technology , whether they &apos;re in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a feature of this <unk> .
if we go back to this , what would the 2020 look like this ?
it should be again the two elements again .
we should use the <unk> to get reducing the way , the less us , the <unk> will be smaller and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but actually , this note is that the thing that we &apos;re doing , which are not completely too much more , or even less importantly , the the other , the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs have to track and we can follow , and we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this subject .
so al gore book &quot; we have the choice , and david <unk> <unk> energy <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework that can be discussed across the range of the , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s some things that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very more comfortable wish we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> <unk> without the co2 , i would take that wish to take .
this has the largest effect .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between long and in the <unk> , people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poorest and the rich <unk> and almost all the lives of this two billion are going to be much worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do i do for the things that i do ?
we need to use for more research .
when countries are in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should discuss these <unk> , and they were shocked by the very small funds that are being spent for these innovative ways .
we need <unk> , taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the news .
we have to have to bring a dialogue and more and the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , you can tell us an idea of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few 10 million , and even if we have tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s a reasonable works , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to build the first <unk> , and find more billion , and the place of the actually building the first of it .
and once the first finished , if it &apos;s going to , like i promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic density , the energy density is so different than <unk> , as we know it .
to understand that right , that means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column , that consumed by a vertical column , that consumed , and then the process begins to the turn and work on the bottom ?
<unk> : right now , you have to <unk> the reactor , so there are lots and lots of the controls , and you can go wrong . this thing where you open it and and things like it and things like it and things like it and things like it and things like it and things like it and things like it .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think about a column -- they bury , without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s going to be done for the next and it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , the self offers a solution for the waste .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to waste : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this kind -- then you take it in the next bucket and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which already exists in this <unk> or <unk> , that &apos;s our <unk> .
so what these reactors is a problem , what we put in our place and so that it will reduce the <unk> dramatic during the process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people around the world over these ways .
where is the biggest interest in this way that really do ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t yet put it up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting <unk> for everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; -- there &apos;s huge interest and people of the company , in india , india , china -- i &apos;ve talked to the <unk> and talk about how this is the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese have something to be in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was done .
it &apos;s a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster , and some countries have this built , so everybody who built a fast reactor , a <unk> for our first .
so in your idea , a timeline and chance to start calling this in life ?
<unk> : well we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very inexpensive , we have 20 years to the design and then it &apos;s about 20 years to the .
this is kind of the deadline that we &apos;ve got the <unk> of the <unk> that we need to follow .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , it &apos;s dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of , as well , when their work work for their pilots , for their local pilots , for the <unk> .
and it would be the best if it &apos;s going to get several , because then you could use a mixture .
so , anyway , we need a solution .
so the great idea of great breakthroughs is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it would be without the <unk> , but it &apos;s still the way that it &apos;s much more important .
so in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular technique , this is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe they &apos;re telling us .
and so , there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times a million times a lot of energy , like a , we say , a <unk> , and that &apos;s why they can handle problems and they are mostly the radiation , the footprint and the costs , the the power of the country and the costs , the impact , the impact , the the power , the impact , the the power , the potential , the impact , the the power , the potential , the impact , the the
if it doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to turn to <unk> to try to hold the <unk> stable ?
<unk> : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you too much too much , and you have a a heart attack , what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like that .
there &apos;s a <unk> called <unk> , which is the various techniques to <unk> warming , so we have 20 or 30 years to us .
it &apos;s just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at all the insurance because you might eat the insurance , so you &apos;re going to eat because you know that one will save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know whether that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re concerned about the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a conversation in <unk> , whether you should have that , if things come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
<unk> : have you one or two sentences for you to convince you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camp .
those who are doing the scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative implications to do the way to do the way ?
there &apos;s very , very few things that you can tell you about that there &apos;s a chance to be in a million .
the <unk> is like aids here is like aids .
you make the errors , and you pay for it very much later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems in something that you &apos;re just going to be , and that &apos;s what the investment is not necessarily , and it &apos;s actually , the <unk> report doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the worst , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and there &apos;s no a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should worry about this uncertainty .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and then the co2 hits , then the skeptic , &quot; well , it &apos;s not interested in the , i wish it didn &apos;t be a carbon <unk> , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon <unk> , i wish it that it &apos;s a lot more than it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method .
and this would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , the <unk> , the <unk> , that is a stupid waste of malaria , the <unk> , that causes a stupid waste of resources , and so on , it &apos;s better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual amount of research for research -- say , the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year a year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it doesn &apos;t have to suffer other things .
you get to a big <unk> , and there &apos;s no sensible people disagree , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund it . for me , most of my waste .
it &apos;s a very short , a <unk> and funded , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be very much less less .
if the <unk> of the <unk> , you get a very high <unk> , then the rich can keep up there .
i mean , every one of us here can spend five times as much for our energy to change their lifestyle .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster disaster .
and even <unk> thinks about .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is not going to be done on research anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories associated with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so he &apos;s now bringing the <unk> .
and this is a thought i think about appropriate .
so , research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it is being supported .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> , peter <unk> , called &quot; the <unk> .
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have to the largest largest structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti , about three feet tape , about three feet thread and make a marshmallow .
the marshmallow is to be on top .
and , even though it seems really easy , it &apos;s really difficult to work , because it &apos;s always constantly working with work very fast .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
and then i &apos;ve been done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this task , which is what deep impressions in nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them with them .
usually , most people start to get to the task of themselves .
you talk about it , you think about how it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s <unk> .
then they invest a little bit of time and organization . it &apos;s an image and lay spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time in the <unk> of the time .
and finally , before you have no time , take the marshmallow , and you put it gently on the top , step back and a step back and &quot; <unk> , &quot; admire your work .
but then , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; to &quot; <unk> &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is the whole thing to do and <unk> .
there &apos;s a set of people who have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , and under the worst , fresh <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re confused and they really <unk> <unk> .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , and under the best , fresh <unk> members of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
and as we told peter , peter told , they &apos;re not only the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter said , &quot; no kids spend a lot of children at the head of spaghetti to be <unk> .
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that , <unk> , they were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then it to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different in the things that they &apos;re going to start with the marshmallow and prototypes , successful prototypes , and the marshmallow at the top , so they have the opportunity to repair the <unk> prototype .
<unk> is the kind of collaboration , the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with each attempt , the kids get immediately feedback , and what don &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but we see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of the is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they triangles and <unk> geometric patterns are key to build properly structures .
ceos are on average , but here &apos;s interesting .
you put an <unk> administrator on the team , they will significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why are this ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they conduct the process , you understand it .
and that team that regulates down and the work is going to be the performance of the team significantly .
and more specialized skills and <unk> and their combination are making .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , they get to be about six , they get to work properly structures .
so i was trying to try to something interesting .
i thought , we &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
so i offered a <unk> prize for the winner .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . didn &apos;t have a very strong structure .
if anyone built a <unk> high construction , it would have worn the price to home .
so it &apos;s not interesting that high school is a strong effect ?
we repeated this bonding exercise with the same students .
what do you think it was ?
now they understood the benefit of the .
that &apos;s how the same , bad team is one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
you might ask , why would someone do in time to create a <unk> of a <unk> ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , to help , and to make video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> is , they &apos;re helping to identify with the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project is its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , or to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience that this is simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in , can come to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> .
you find a crazy examples of all around the world , how people manage the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the most exciting thing i think is that construction is actually a sport sport .
it demands that we all the our senses to the task , and we think we &apos;re using our thinking of how our emotions and our do , in the challenge that lies us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; moment to be &quot; moment . &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so we have this as we would have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve asked my friends in time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or the twitter , or &quot; america &apos;s about the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re somehow drawn to the <unk> , to be <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i am a explorers .
it &apos;s because of the potential of this planet doesn &apos;t go back , you go forward .
so i want to this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we ever had on this planet , no matter what we &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , declining <unk> .
there was never a time ago like this .
my <unk> , all of them died than they were 60 .
my grandparents were getting this number to <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so , there should be better at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that in new delhi today is born to live in delhi , as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
they also kind of the demographics of the earth in a way , like it &apos;s no war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them <unk> . phew .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have even threatened by one generation .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anybody know anybody else ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try things , look , if it &apos;s not going to change if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they were talked about .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements have a billion people on this world every day , to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very quickly , and that &apos;s an shame .
and not only that , we have the imagination to ruin this world , and i &apos;m not going to ruin this world .
drinking drinking water , <unk> land , rainforests , oil , gas , and if we don &apos;t come out of this mess , we &apos;re also going to disappear from this mess .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions without the country , to rape and raping them .
i think we can supply this world with energy that they &apos;re not destroyed at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this is holding up at night -- one of the things that sit down at night , we have never been so necessarily necessarily necessarily as well as now , never even more .
and we also had never been able to have it <unk> , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the cusp of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and i really think that we have been hundreds , 300 years ago , i think we have to go back to a time where we have to have a time to find a time in which we have in the progress of the other things .
people membranes themselves in their belief , so tightly , they can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth will free .
and listen , everybody has a fairly <unk> , even a real way to do it .
but you know what you &apos;re not right ?
they don &apos;t quite on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they don &apos;t have them .
and i took a while to find this .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about max for &quot; the new yorker , a little article .
and i was struck to the resistance , to be <unk> toward the , which is the most effective activity in the health care of the health care of the health care of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon i was a very , i wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve written a paper on this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they believed that molecules was a certain kind of <unk> , a random way of a <unk> <unk> .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i was going on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re typing we &apos;re going to get food , that &apos;s okay .
but these articles made me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally , i found it .
and it &apos;s because these fanatics who didn &apos;t know me crazy at all .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that blew me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , we know what .
we &apos;re at a point where we &apos;re not the same relationship to the progress of the time .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about that , with a little quotes about this , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what are these reasons .
we have the confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be so .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , weapons of weapons of weapons of mass .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we believed they were still quite a way . so they were skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , ask for evidence .
take nothing to take .
but now it comes . if you get the evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can tell the reason that we have now in an epidemic of fear as i never seen it , and hopefully i will never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very frightening .
there were tons of studies have been done to see if that was true .
so many studies should be done ; this is a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , canada , and they all were the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see what we see what we see what we &apos;re seeing what we &apos;re feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a <unk> of documents from a <unk> that &apos;s us , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was devastating .
disaster because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> are falling down for measles .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand this . i &apos;m doing .
because anybody &apos;s sitting there ?
does one one in the audience die dying dying dying ?
not quite a lot .
this country doesn &apos;t even happen in this country , but the <unk> times in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t here here , we can be able to get it in denial , and people like the jenny can walk around and and <unk> and <unk> and illiteracy and illiteracy and larry king &apos;s live .
and that can make them because they &apos;re not connecting cause and link .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he &apos;s a <unk> of the worst human human rights .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vanished .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people .
it can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good , except that paul &apos;s walking and learning about vaccines and says how much they are , and that people just stop doing it .
and this is actually what he says .
paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks about a public <unk> , he can &apos;t tell him without arms <unk> .
he gets calls home , because people love telling him to know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them on , they &apos;re going to go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;re now on this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon children are going to die again because it &apos;s just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not dying dying dying .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s assume that . why not ?
a <unk> of my <unk> was written in a couple of weeks , and i i think i am a little too <unk> .
nobody said that the one has said .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate your child against <unk> . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t yesterday yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe in the morning , in lagos morning , and fly to los angeles , at the moment he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to be one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that way the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love it to lie to us . we love that .
did you all taken their vitamins tomorrow ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , you &apos;re helping you to make the .
i know you &apos;ve made that because half americans that makes it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternate , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly doing this .
they make their urine . more than never .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark .
i &apos;m totally pleased to them .
dark , urine . dark .
so why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust into the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t be it . our health care system is .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> self that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away from the way , and where we &apos;re going to do ?
we &apos;re running in the arms of the <unk> .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because it &apos;s crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all sorts of little <unk> here .
none of them -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? when i say that , people will get me and say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people do , let people do what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , says , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to be the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patient with <unk> .
if they &apos;re going to get away to this way , where believe and magic is replacing science and science , they &apos;re going to be a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people in it because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know they can get the course of aids .
hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country that will be <unk> every other from this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
now the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re in is this weird struggle between the <unk> genetically <unk> food and the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> debate . it needs to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every <unk> , every branch of <unk> , every <unk> , every <unk> , was changing by the people .
you know , there was no <unk> in paradise .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we &apos;ve done this all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last prime 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve got rid of what it doesn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more more , and , of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions million people , and to extend millions of people , their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we hold genetically <unk> food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m going to hear is : too many chemicals , these are , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to be giant fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to be able to be able to be .
we don &apos;t want companies own seeds .
and you know what my answer is all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix it .
it &apos;s right , we have a huge <unk> , but it &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and it &apos;s sometimes , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of being a real <unk> , and it holds millions of people from the flow of the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ?
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff that &apos;s eating stuff , like cassava .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half a billion people .
it &apos;s about like a potato .
it &apos;s just a sack of calories . it &apos;s it .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this just one .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we do this ?
i mean , ask , ask , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to make genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our hold on greater food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not about rice <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to understand the time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do that , we &apos;re guilty of something that we think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , <unk> colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our own , and we have to really stop it .
so after this incredibly fun puzzle , you may want to say , &quot; you want to be able to go into this ridiculous time time and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to be in any case .
so , in the present moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time time all we want to do .
we can <unk> them , where we want to <unk> them , and we will move them to where we want .
we have to run this conversations , and we have to think , but if we go into the time time and we will be happy to have this .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that &apos;s now now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while i &apos;m interested in the <unk> , it may seem strange to be a magician for it , because , you look like me as a &quot; a deception that will be something truly , if someone is just stuck enough . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown in some of a measurable effect , which is because the person thinks what it &apos;s going to be , is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a <unk> or a kind of -- in the body , for example , there &apos;s a kind of a kind of thing , is a kind of thing that you think is , is a kind of a , like this , a kind of -- in the body that you call the <unk>
a deception will be into something real because somebody &apos;s so aware it .
so we &apos;re also able to understand each other , i want to show you a basic trick of a very simple trick .
and i &apos;ll show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least for the 1950s in any children &apos;s <unk> .
i even learned him from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;ll introduce it to you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife just so on my hand .
i tie my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or from it , i &apos;m just going to be my wrist right here .
in this way you can see that no time is going to move anything , as long as i can here , nothing can go to my sleeve or come .
and the goal is quite easy .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully when everything comes right , the knife will held by my naked and magnetism .
it &apos;s actually in the way that i can shake it without that the knife is like .
nothing goes into my sleeve , and it comes out , no <unk> . and you can study everything .
yay !
now , this is a trick i often get little kids who are interested in this , because you can learn a lot about deception , when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably , you know , many of you here in the room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say , i &apos;m my wrist <unk> to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or coming out and this is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m my wrist , is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
and at the moment , where i mean , my hand of you , you &apos;re going to see from the back , this finger , my <unk> , just from where he was , in a position , where he was so <unk> .
great trick ?
there &apos;s the back in the back , someone who had no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . right there .
and when i <unk> myself , the fingers will going to be his position .
and now you could talk about this , why this is a deception , you know , you &apos;re just going to see three fingers , because the mind and the way he process information is , they &apos;re not one , one , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but this is not actually , it &apos;s not in this , and then i open my hand .
of course , it gets stuck there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a twist , by my favorite , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing by getting <unk> , through this movement , that the fingers will be <unk> .
i take that hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
this is the trick can you your friends and your neighbors . thank you .
now , what did that have to do with the <unk> ?
a year or so , i read a study that really was my head .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing to me .
and what &apos;s this was that if you have a dummy placebo in a white ball , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round of white pill that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you &apos;re the shape that you give it to give it to give you a smaller pill , and this blue color and a letters that is actually measurably more powerful .
and that , although , although , although none of these are any <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really freaking me .
it turns out that it &apos;s not everything yet .
when you take more concrete , it &apos;s more effective than any shape .
a colored capsule that &apos;s at the end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage is a role .
a pill is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance that you injected into a patient .
it &apos;s a very powerful picture in your head . this is very much more powerful than a white pill .
this is really -- i &apos;ll show you another time you &apos;re going to show you a projector .
so , in fact , the white ball doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the needle .
and none of it has a really insidious feature , and it &apos;s only our belief that we have a stronger impact in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magician .
i suppose that &apos;s a deception , and it &apos;s really going to look real .
we know from this study that you have to reach into needle , if it &apos;s supposed to be to the needle .
this is a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , and i &apos;m going to do you a little bit of something .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect .
i &apos;m going to stick that needle into my skin and get through it , and it &apos;s going to get it down to the other side .
if you &apos;re wary , if you &apos;re going to smoke -- i &apos;ve assembled a few friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and this is a woman almost powerless powerless .
so i propose to propose you &apos;re going to get wary , you &apos;ll look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it in the same , but you can also <unk> if you want .
so , this is what my meat starts to be the lower part of my desk , i just get a little <unk> .
i &apos;m real sorry . do you crazy it crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , again , again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation we had to <unk> .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you to you . this is one , two , three , five , five .
now , yes .
i know what people think when you see it .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so dumb and <unk> itself to skin , just to talk a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what &apos;s this from ? pretty well .
yeah , i know .
and the people back in the back , say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right right . &quot;
people in the <unk> come in now .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect .
this is my flesh , and i can <unk> the <unk> .
sorry . if you &apos;re wary , look away , look at them .
the people back in the back , the one later , you see , you know , you &apos;re going to see , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it was really impressive , but if it was really , it &apos;s a hole and there , it &apos;s a hole and there , it &apos;s a hole and there , if it really really , it would bleed to bleed .
okay , let me get a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
so , normally , i would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this scale here and with the intention of a deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle just in there and so on stage .
we &apos;re going to meet the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re excited . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness .
i have some people who have been counted the number of books that are published in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was more more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these sand work , there are several cognitive ones that i think , is almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive <unk> .
this is true for the <unk> who think about their own happiness and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as a mess .
the first one of these are a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just narrow it , but in the big and all of the things that we need to give up , and we will think of the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
the second case is a <unk> of experience and memory : basically you &apos;re going to be in your life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact about how to be the well-being without its meaning to be the meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a <unk> one of my lectures , one story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had a symphony , and it was totally <unk> , and it was totally <unk> sound , and it was a <unk> sound .
and then it added on , really emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t have .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t matter because he was with a recollection of being <unk> ; she was ruined , and she was all of the things he had to keep .
what we really really say is that we &apos;re thinking about ourselves and over other people , in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present and the present , the present , is capable of seeing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self who &apos;s the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now , if i &apos;m you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that , and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor &apos;s the doctor by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel over lately ?
or , how did your journey to albania ? &quot; or like that .
these are two very different units , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two to <unk> is part of the <unk> of happiness .
now , the <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and this is really beginning with a basic reaction to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to begin .
we don &apos;t tell the stories if we make stories to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we &apos;re going to keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with a example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are doing a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to be in detail . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to cover the 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . they are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who was both suffered from two ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient &apos;s clearly , a more <unk> . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient has a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients do that they suffered suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much worse <unk> was the <unk> patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is far worse than the other .
and the worse is the worse , where the pain was very at the end at its peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and too much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing about this ? &quot;
and it was a lot worse than a b is for a b.
now this is a direct conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> itself .
from the view of the <unk> itself , a <unk> <unk> .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did a clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> a single bit , and you can just put the <unk> of the space without a very <unk> .
it will lead to the patient &apos;s the patient , but a little less than it .
and if you make that a few minutes , you have a way that the <unk> itself is a bad , and you have it makes the <unk> itself a much better , because , you have a patient a a better story about his experience .
so , what is a story of a story ?
and this is true for the stories that makes us and it also also for the stories we invent .
and so , a story of a story is <unk> , meaningful moments and ending .
and they &apos;re very , very important and in this case , <unk> .
now , the <unk> itself lives is continuously alive .
it &apos;s got moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask , what &apos;s going to be with these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve been doing this -- you know , psychological present than about three seconds . what means you know , there are about 600 million of them , in a month , it &apos;s a <unk> .
most of you are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet they get the idea that you should be counted , that what &apos;s happening during this time of the ocean coast of life .
it &apos;s the finite resource we use during this world .
and as we use it , it &apos;s important , but it &apos;s not the story that keeps the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is dealing with time .
from view of the <unk> itself , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
this is how it &apos;s not working on the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself , a <unk> vacation is barely better than the <unk> holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time , is the critical variable that is different from a <unk> self , time , time has a very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> itself makes more than to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , we say two <unk> at two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then the one that &apos;s intended , then the one that &apos;s intended , then the one that &apos;s intended , and that is the surgeon who is selected .
the <unk> itself has no voice in this option .
we don &apos;t choose to choose between experience . we choose between memories of memories .
and even if we think about the future , we think about our future , don &apos;t usually be as a experience .
we think about our future after a <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is the <unk> self through experience that the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need .
i have the idea that if we &apos;re doing a vacation , which is , we &apos;re doing vacation on vacation , we &apos;re doing vacation on the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit difficult to justify .
i mean , how do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday we &apos;ve made a couple of years ago in antarctica , the most the best vacation i had ever had , and i think quite often , in proportion to other as often i think about other people .
and i &apos;ve probably been to my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes over the last four years .
now , if i opened the the folder folder with 600 images in this 600 images .
now , this is three weeks , and this is just a half a year .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , like little , i have your memory &apos;s memory , but even if you &apos;re doing more of them , it &apos;s a real question . why are we give memories so much weight in the <unk> of the weight of what we &apos;re going to do ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that the end of the <unk> all of the pictures are crushed and they get a <unk> drug , so they &apos;re going to be remembered .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose a on a vacation , there is a conflict between their two types of self , and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not even obvious , because if you get the sense of time , because if you get the sense of time .
why we choose the <unk> of the , we choose a problem that &apos;s a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness on the happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use one one self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that are now being measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to make a pretty good idea about the happiness of the <unk> itself over time .
if you &apos;re looking at the happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not what &apos;s happy to live .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy is the person when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
each other who don &apos;t learn from these terms is not different from the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being that are the exploration of happiness , are actually these things up .
the distinction between the happiness itself and the satisfaction of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two .
the gallup organization has been a worldwide survey where more than half a million people are asking , what they think about their lives and about their lives , and there were other effort in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the two ways of self .
and the main thing that we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone &apos;s happy with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really tell you much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the relationship , the link is about <unk> .
what what that means is that if you &apos;d meet someone , and you would say you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
and if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight to a scale of a scale , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> self .
so the correlation is low .
we know what the happiness of the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , destinations are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly to be happy with people who we like to spend time to people who we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to ignore the two of the two kinds of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
so the implication of what i said here is that we really should be really not going to be a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , another reason , we know , one of the reason we &apos;re not clear about happiness is that we don &apos;t even consider the same thing if we think about life , and when we live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to be the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people in california have to be happier if you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self that decides how happy people are .
but , because the <unk> itself is responsible , you can get at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are getting happier to california , to get happier .
well , your <unk> self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , how terrible the weather in ohio was , and they &apos;re going to feel that they have the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question .
thank you .
now , when we told a couple of weeks ago , i talked to me that there was a pretty interesting result that this place was going to survey .
is this something that you can do in you , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we have absolutely not to find .
we found this in terms of the happiness itself .
when we looked at how emotions are spinning .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a great representative sample under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they become more less less less than the poorer .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t have a <unk> , but that lack of money would be miserable , and we can &apos;t measure this misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of self , the <unk> itself , you get a different story .
the more money you get the happier happier .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but , people , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s freedom , freedom , the pursuit of bliss .
so if people take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything we believe in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country generally would take a <unk> like seriously , and based on politics on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think there &apos;s credit for the role of the world &apos;s health care .
the recognition will become slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s just happening in other countries .
people are in the ways that you should think about politics , if you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are debating whether they want to explore <unk> or whether to explore <unk> , so we have to have this conversation quite soon .
how you &apos;re lucky , you can grow very different depending on how they think and whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self or whether you think about the <unk> self .
it &apos;s going to change politics , i think in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to have to measure the most unhealthy population .
this is going to think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , or should be the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m going to design video games .
i &apos;ve now develop a <unk> of the time for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade , to make it easy to save the world in reality , how to save in <unk> .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them to spend more and more <unk> games .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time when you think how many problems we need to solve the real world .
in fact , my research at the institute of the the future is to explain the the opposite of the future is the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most challenging problems .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to grow the next century on this planet , we have to increase the time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time at 21 billion hours a week .
this is something that seems to be something more , so repeat i can work , if we &apos;re dealing with problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we have to do , and we &apos;re going to do play online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean , i &apos;m really seriously .
why ? this image is quite very , why i think games are so vital for survival of human species in the future .
this is a tudor portrait of photographer phil <unk> .
he wanted to put the emotions to play , so he &apos;s got a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may give you some of the mysteries in this picture .
you may probably see this sense of urgency , but also , you know , very , very , very , very , very , very , very difficult to solve a problem .
and if you &apos;re playing , you see some of the very , and the <unk> eyes , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the verge of a <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> victory is a result that &apos;s so much as a positive is that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you get it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a <unk> victory .
this guy is a short victory before a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions faces across the world , if we take the the next century to the next century , the face of the <unk> , the opposite of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this face of real life when we &apos;re difficult problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
this is me , like i &apos;m &quot; in life i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my modern home in berkeley , california , where i was in my thesis , we &apos;re better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as in games .
and i &apos;m not just going to succeed my own , even though that &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , in the relationship with motivation , to do something more , inspired to work with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i think , many of us are going to be able to solve our best version , anytime and immediately , to solve the problem , as it required for the long term , it &apos;s going to try again .
and in reality , when we fail , when we hit obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel , we &apos;re feeling threatened , you know , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings have never when we play games , they just don &apos;t just exist .
and this is what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible to play , think , you couldn &apos;t just reach anything ?
how can we put these feelings from the games in the reality ?
so , i looked like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment to collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that have the <unk> victories in <unk> .
so first , when you get in one of these <unk> , particularly in world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are willing to give you a <unk> mission , and it immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly at the end of your level , right ?
so , you can do it .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and it &apos;s <unk> , and there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they &apos;re also going to work , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to cover their epic mission .
we don &apos;t really just think that in real life , this sense that there is a <unk> of employees .
and also , this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we &apos;re doing .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have come from &quot; level high and &quot; <unk> 1 , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; an intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i &apos;m not like , and i &apos;m like a talk and a crazy idea , and a crazy idea , a <unk> <unk> idea .
i get real life in this feedback .
so , the problem of the world &apos;s like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying , at any time on a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , that we would rather spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so far , all the world of <unk> have spent millions million years to solve the virtual problems of the <unk> .
it &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it sounds bad .
but to see it in the context , a million years ago , we started going to go upright .
so the first so primate so .
okay , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play , the only sense when you &apos;re at the time of the scale of human development , what &apos;s extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s appropriate . because it turns out , by doing this whole time on play , actually change what we are capable of .
we develop collaborative , so , very well .
that &apos;s the truth . i think i think .
consider this interesting statistic , recent recent recent came published , the average young man in a country with huge <unk> 10,000 hours of <unk> to the 21st of year .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two reasons .
first once , for children in the united states , <unk> hours of the <unk> <unk> , spend the great high school to end up high school -- if you never have to do .
so we have a complete <unk> here , where young people learn as well as learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of you read the new book by him , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know his theory of the success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of a significant subject to the 21st of year , we &apos;re to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s going to do , like the most significant people in the world .
so , what we have here is a total generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is : &quot; what are the players are good good ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we could have never been there with the <unk> of human potential .
so many people have been in the world who spend at least an hour a day with <unk> .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good in &quot; something .
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the <unk> of the <unk> developed <unk> , energy save energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so the people around the world , particularly in india , china , brazil online .
you expect to be a extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a total of a billion player .
so i started thinking about what it is to do these games .
here are the four things i found . first , the first thing .
ok , imagine how extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do immediately , a hurdle to master , to believe that we have a secondary hope .
the players always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth it to try and try and it &apos;s just right .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in spiders to social nets .
there &apos;s a lot more interesting research that show you guys like to do , when we &apos;ve been doing , even if you have a bad situation .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we &apos;re confidence that someone has time to us with us , that the rules are going to be the the same goal and to stay on the <unk> .
so the <unk> of the <unk> is growing by <unk> , trust and each other .
and as a result , we make stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , as a <unk> .
the reason is that if we play , we actually are happier to work , when if we relax or nothing .
we know that we &apos;re as human beings , when we do hard , important work .
and they &apos;re always ready to work hard , if they get the right job .
and finally , risd matters .
the players love to love the other , to be the <unk> of <unk> .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the right light to the right . you know , you know , all wikipedia , the largest domain of the world .
the second-largest collection of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been documenting more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other collection in any other collection of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a kind of cosmic source of all the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that are the only outcome . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as individual the world .
and the only thing is that they believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i ... i develop , i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> .
so he says , that makes sense of the <unk> , because players can reach more than in the real life .
they can connect to more powerful social ties than real life , and they get more feedback and rewards in games as real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s perfectly logical that the players are more time in the virtual world than the real ones .
i &apos;m very first to agree that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a <unk> .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
so these fantastic <unk> <unk> were <unk> .
and that was the first of people developed <unk> <unk> .
and when you &apos;re in the works of the old greek <unk> <unk> , you may know this story , and the story about how and why games .
it &apos;s been <unk> <unk> , more more closely , more <unk> , in the kingdom during famine .
it was supposedly , was such a great famine , that king of <unk> was turned to a crazy idea .
people who fought suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it was required an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and on a day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and with <unk> , <unk> productivity , they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and the way they survived for the very 18 years , by looking at a day and the next playing .
and so , i think we &apos;re going to let &apos;s play .
we put games to get the suffering from the real world .
we put games to do everything in the real world , everything that is not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re taking us what we need to play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end up .
this is the exciting .
and the <unk> was not better after 18 years old years , so , the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they split the kingdom in two halves .
they played a <unk> , and the winner was getting into a <unk> adventure .
they went out and they went to a new home , and they just had a lot of people to survive , and they were looking back to the rest of a neighborhood where they could thrive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show shows that the <unk> that later , that the the <unk> kingdom of the that have the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came recently in the notion that <unk> &apos; insane story is .
and geologists found the evidence of a global <unk> , almost 20 years of what was the famine .
so , this is this crazy story .
you may have been saved their people through play , by doing 18 years in games , and then these <unk> and then had a lot of over this one that they were doing all of civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing with in 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played 18 years long , we &apos;ve been playing with all 16 years .
i &apos;m like , we &apos;re ready to play our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half their civilization to the new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should <unk> that half of us should play an hour a day playing with play until we solved the world of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve real world in play ? &quot; and right this question i &apos;ve dedicated my work in the last couple of years on the institute of the future .
we have this flag in in palo alto , it &apos;s how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people empower the idea of this idea into reality .
we put ourselves in experimental wins , give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people in the future of the future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> where you have to have to get a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> to do it , and they really live their real life without any of it , so , if they &apos;re , you &apos;re going to play , you &apos;re going to figure out how they truly do your real life , if it &apos;s true , and we ask them to be it , and we ask them to be , and we ask them to be , and we ask them to be , and we ask them to be , and we ask them to be
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 . and we &apos;ve been tested over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
no one wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to be the oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure to do that .
find out how they would survive , most of our players have the game of the game .
so we have a bigger step for the next <unk> game , a bigger target than just <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for the future .
it &apos;s the point of computation is a <unk> that people are only 23 years on the planet .
so this supercomputer called &quot; global <unk> <unk> , &quot; of course .
the call to the player , <unk> , we almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know , you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; : you have the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> and only together , can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our job , the future of energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players play the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read , when they &apos;re googling . &quot;
and the last game we &apos;re moving on three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of social <unk> , and in 2010 .
we work with universities in the world in the world , and they &apos;re learning a natural social designs .
we have a comic comic comic comic comic -- we have &quot; level to design , <unk> , sustainability and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all of the game to share this game with young people , all over the world , particularly in <unk> , who are benefit together , to save their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to come up with the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic gamers we have to show us what we can do , but we don &apos;t have not rescued the world yet .
well , i hope that you agree that there is the human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to engage in the opposite of social nets , <unk> and desire for more powerful meaning .
i really hope that we play games in this planet to survive more than this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with this kind of play and play .
so if i &apos;m going to the next decade , i &apos;m sure for two things that we can create any future to make any of the future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s get the <unk> .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a few months ago writing a article at the article article .
i &apos;ve always been writing my <unk> , but i was done with the sounds of text , and i realized i &apos;ve never been in my life , which the word &quot; disabled &quot; means &quot;
i &apos;m reading the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
<unk> : healthy , powerful . &quot;
i read this list a friend , and i had to laugh , it didn &apos;t know , but i was just going to go &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop and i had to stop and i had to stop and i had to go to and get me to this <unk> <unk> and and <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought the output was already quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s when i started with elementary school , and i started to build my self and shapes my self , and shapes and shapes in terms of other children and the rest around the world around me .
and god is , i didn &apos;t use a <unk> .
i would be born to this point seriously , i would be born to a world that someone would be positive in any of the sense of life , but today i am going to be the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately navigated to the <unk> of the <unk> of the 2009 , and i expected i find a <unk> .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a lot better .
and especially the last two words , under &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people who describe this words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
many of the most vulnerable societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed the pronunciation was a huge force , because what you &apos;re laughing out loud , and it can also be <unk> .
so , what do we really want to <unk> -- one of the people &apos;s in the world , or a powerful people ?
just to call a human being in a child , it could be willing to limit them and illustrate them .
wouldn &apos;t it be more beautiful to open the doors ?
a human being opened for me , my pediatrician at the <unk> <unk> institute in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think most americans didn &apos;t make it , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. legend was born very colorful and fly and was just how to do with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my <unk> .
i had to repeat the <unk> infinite , and <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know to build my <unk> , and i hated these ribbons . &quot; and i hated these ribbons . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a child with dr. p. and how to stop doing this exercise , <unk> without success .
and one day he was watching me in one of my practiced -- these work was just boring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so much as powerful and young girls , you &apos;ll take one one day one of these tape .
and if you can do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and this was just a simple trick from dr. legend , so i wanted to do the procedure that i didn &apos;t want to do with the chance that the the future of the world &apos;s richest five five year-old girl in the hospital , but he actually brought me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes .
and i &apos;m going to ask myself , how much his vision of me as powerful and incredibly powerful girls my sense of self , and i could imagine myself as a creation of nature , powerful and <unk> .
this is just an example of how adults can stimulate the imagination of a child .
but as the already <unk> examples of the <unk> prove , our language doesn &apos;t make us a room , to imagine what we would all would want to be able to make it every single person to be themselves as powerful people .
our language <unk> the social change , which has been triggered by a technological change .
so from the medical view , you can say that my legs , the <unk> of titan and artificial <unk> for the aging body that allow people to really take all their choices and complaining about the limits that allow people to really use their own natural destiny , and they &apos;re going to develop a sense of natural fate , and the boundaries that allow them to really make their natural destiny .
so , perhaps this is what this technological change may be more clearly , because the other person has been a very <unk> and very powerful and very powerful can be <unk> and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to be in this -- this is an interesting story , because people ask me to tell you , i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m saying to tell you , this sentence , for me , and i &apos;m always very uncomfortable to ask people to answer people and i think , i understand why .
this set of the <unk> of the <unk> is that success or happiness on the idea that it &apos;s a challenge , to master , without being being affected by the associated experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could drop the possible one drop of a prosthetic and and people with my disability .
but the truth is that we change , of course , we &apos;re really aware of the challenge , whether it physically , emotionally or even both the two .
and i &apos;m saying that that &apos;s good .
<unk> is not a obstacle that we have to have to make with our lives better .
<unk> is just to our lives .
and i tend to look at <unk> as my shadow .
and i realize that he &apos;s very , and sometimes he &apos;s barely too , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i want to argue with this is the impact , or the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are the life of the and challenges , and they &apos;re just real and every person &apos;s going different , but the question is not , but the question is not , we &apos;re going to be , but we can &apos;t come to it .
so we &apos;re not responsible for people who we love to keep the <unk> , but they prepare to get it to come to it .
and we don &apos;t even find our kids , if we give them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to know two things : to one the medical fact , an amputee , and to the other part of the social opinion , whether i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only one and sustained disability with me to put myself , is that the world is constantly , you could describe me with this definitions .
in our wish to protect the people who are at us at the heart , and you the cool , hard truth about their medical projections or even a heightened to quality of life , which you expect , we need to look at that we don &apos;t have a lot of the way that somebody is actually disabled .
and maybe the process is the process of what &apos;s going to look at what &apos;s going in a break , and how we repair the repair , for each one larger disability than the pathology pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human and treat all its forces and opportunities and realize , we can also have to the natural struggle that may lead to the natural struggle that you may have to lead , another disease .
we &apos;re <unk> a human , which is a value for our society .
so we have to focus beyond the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> and focus on all the area of the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our mismatch and our great <unk> , there is a connection .
we should not be able to avoid this <unk> times or neither , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it , and we should be under the carpet , but it &apos;s about the <unk> opportunity .
it &apos;s a more bit more about that , we know , we don &apos;t necessarily have to get to the way , but that we &apos;re open to embrace them , to embrace them up to a <unk> , and maybe even dancing with it .
and maybe we can do it , <unk> as a natural , <unk> and useful , and feel like their presence in their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 years of the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in my eyes , in a very true in human characters .
i would rearrange it . it &apos;s not the most powerful , but not the <unk> of his way , but that the way changes the best changes .
post-conflict conflicts arises .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and <unk> , the struggle of the human mind is determined by itself by conflict .
so again , again , change and adaptation are the greatest attributes of people .
and maybe we know what &apos;s when we &apos;re going to get the wood , when we &apos;re really tested .
and it may be the sense of <unk> , a sense of the <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning to be beyond the opposite ages .
maybe we can see <unk> as change as change .
<unk> are on a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to us yet .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s see it &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
they &apos;re the usual . the typical . but not the normal , and they would really learn that poor , grey person really want to learn to learn if they really would be ?
i think , rather than .
it would be great if we put this paradigm of the normal , or the strength to make it even a little bit more difficult , exchange , so we can invite the forces of very much more and valuable skills in society .
<unk> found out that we have a people who have always have a budget : useful to be useful and to do a contributions .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthal had a neanderthal of 60,000 years ago , older people with heavy physical injury and that was perhaps because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of these people &apos;s worth of society .
they didn &apos;t have this as being broken and useless , and they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city i was growing up in a <unk> in the <unk> of the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , like a guy behind me , &quot; well , if you don &apos;t know aimee . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember remember . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i was going to get her your mother from the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s done , and then you &apos;re doing .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , who i was just from telling my mother &apos;s mother , because i was of course , very typical , my birthday , two weeks .
the doctor &apos;s doctor , medical medical imaging , my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on this and a few toes had to be the <unk> , he was the <unk> , this strangers , this particular way to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you that you would never walk , and never being treated like other kids , or that you can never take a independently of independently and then , and they just lie to lie .
and really , i found that he was <unk> my entire childhood , whether i was in a <unk> class in the second class , whether i was the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , whether i had my scholarship or one of my <unk> <unk> , and he used these round to teach his students , <unk> medical school and medical medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough to stress how important that can be in the quality of your human life .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re all the time , and if they get a little bit of support , if you get kids , if you can get kids , and then children can get a lot of them . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his mind .
he had understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone treats it , two different things .
and i also think my thinking about time when you were asked me at age 15 years , if you were asked to be my prosthetics for legs and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second <unk> .
i wanted to be normal in the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure .
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not even of this experience .
and maybe this change could happen to this change because i &apos;ve been met so many people who have opened me the doors , instead of people who wanted me to me , and i want to make a idea of my imagination .
see it really needs a person who can give you how to be able to <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through .
and if you allow to somebody to activate its own , inside forces -- the human spirit is so <unk> -- if you can open that , and for someone in a critical moment , a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open up the doors .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot;
it means something that &apos;s in one , the potential to be the potential .
again , what potential would we want to be able to do ?
in the 1960s , in the 1960s , in the &apos; 60s , was a case case , then <unk> <unk> .
they call this this there &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the u.s. we call it as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are going to be .
and the a student will review , <unk> , the better teachers and so forth .
you then have a <unk> of the students with a &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; very good , &quot; it was told you , they were very clever , and after that three months , she really wrote <unk> .
and of course it would have to hear the heart , that vice versa , it was only enough other .
and it &apos;s just like to the three months .
but only those who still were in school -- except by the students who had had the school .
so the key thing in this study was that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just said that was the <unk> and that the students with the grade , and they were taught them to them and they treated them .
the only thing is a <unk> mind is a mind , which has been broken , has no hope . he finds no hope to tell him our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> capacity of imagination .
but if we can , to support the human spirit , continue to hope and other people around them beautiful , and i think of the other people to be beautiful , and i think we &apos;re really a to put our powers .
if a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new arrangements .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that by a saint poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and i was told my friend jacques <unk> <unk> , and the poem is &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than they &apos;re right ?
suppose i said , by a few changes your genes , a better memory might be -- more and more and faster .
or want you to be more powerful , stronger power .
do you want to attractive and more confident ?
how would it be more good for good health ?
or maybe they are one of whom are always on more creativity .
which would you like most like it ?
what would you like to have you like , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
a couple . probably , about how many people are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose to choose a good thing ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to be a doctor .
if you could only have one one , it would be a very different world .
is that just a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
so evolution is a <unk> issue here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the one of a doctor &apos;s view .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you get rid of your personal -- -- i give you the personal -- and you may have a look at the personal -- and you may have a look at the <unk> &apos; book .
but if you accept biologic evolution , you think about this : it &apos;s just about the past , or is about the future ?
is it it for other <unk> , or it &apos;s us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the existing <unk> in these quarries have had success , and it &apos;s its environment , and strength . it &apos;s how it &apos;s like it .
the human part of this <unk> , far , of course , is that , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we branch from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of hominids .
some have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we were right to the other parts of the tree tree , but actually the greatest part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
so , is you clear that we can use and the mechanisms of a survey can produce the protein of human <unk> , which is used to treat diabetic diabetic ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically <unk> from what &apos;s the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about bacteria is aware that every of us in our gut , more bacteria than the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times a lot of times .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio &apos;s my sense of self , thinking about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s dissolved , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you will all the nutrients that they could only want to be their own effort without effort .
it &apos;s really a long way to bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended , <unk> forced to leave the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , same as they are important for their lives .
they help to fertilize the value of nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come to the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> equilibrium in a species ?
or are we something else to become -- something that may even adapted to the environment ?
so let &apos;s go back a step back in the outside of 14 billion years ago -- the earth , about a four billion years ago -- the first sign of living , maybe three to four billion years years ago , the first <unk> organisms , perhaps as a a billion years ago , and then the first <unk> organisms , maybe as a a billion years ago .
in this huge astronomical symphony of the universe , life is just about the earth just a little bit about ; the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope , sebastian ate it .
now , when i was a <unk> of college , i had my first <unk> .
i was obsessed with the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i put something very basic in the most of the existence in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to run into two <unk> .
but at the time , as a multicellular organisms , came up , things began to change things .
sexual reproduction are reproduction into the picture .
and importantly , with introducing sexual reproduction , which is the rest of the body will be <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the <unk> of death of death in the same moment is to be the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death -- it seemed quite a <unk> of sex -- it seemed quite a reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my more generation .
i &apos;ve come to the other hand of george burns , who read in las vegas in las vegas , in las vegas .
and one night , there is a pat on its <unk> .
it opens the door .
he &apos;s a very beautifully <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization , as a doctor , i was a goal of the other thing about the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to keep the body to keep the body .
i wanted to hold ourselves healthy .
i wanted to restore health to a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all over the process of the creation of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary point , you &apos;re , and i &apos;ve been developing rockets to the next stage of orbit to the next stage of orbit to the next stage of orbit to the sea .
i think we would all the mood , the masters of all the expression as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality through my work .
i want to get to die by i don &apos;t die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily the largest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the greatest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are moving on their environment .
it &apos;s the only test of survival and success .
and on the reason of the ocean , bacteria are available , and then the hot thing would survive , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum , they have a vacuum , they have a <unk> environment there for themselves .
so , what does that mean , when we look back to what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space , people in evolution , and particularly like we <unk> <unk> into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is we &apos;re going to be going to be .
we &apos;ve done a way of equilibrium .
and the reason for this would be , first of medicine , we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes that were otherwise been otherwise , and from the population .
and secondly , we as a species we have our environment so <unk> that they &apos;re concerned in the way that they adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and and mix us so much that they can &apos;t be able to say that isolation is necessary for the evolution to <unk> .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional ways , of course , the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels is slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far the isolation , when we cover the species of a species , it will be able to be able and the changes of the environment , the evolution of natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , intriguing and scary .
i call it <unk> -- the new development of course , which is not just the , but led us to make us as a <unk> of the choices we do .
now , how did that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so , let &apos;s look at the reality that people are doing today in some cultures decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choices to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible to choose the sex of your child , but also the body of genetic adaptations , to be able to cure pathology and prevent pathology .
what if you could do the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate or even more or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it lasted for years .
it cost billions of dollars .
and in the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
now , you can put a sequence of three billion base base base of the human genome is about 50,000 dollars to the room of about a week .
it will not take more long to be the reality , that it will be a $ 1,000 500 of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
one week , the national academy of the academy of engineering was the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists that are encouraging independently and to make the natural process of evolution to work faster and to make proteins into a more efficient way -- which is called <unk> <unk> &quot; direct evolution .
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientists <unk> was awarded to a research where he took a grown-up <unk> , a <unk> , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell , induced them into a pluripotent stem cells -- a cell in the position of any cell in your body .
these changes are come .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria that are not only protection , but also to serve the immunity to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study that we have to influenza in the cells of a <unk> injury .
can you imagine a little good idea that made out of tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future will be more possible .
so , imagine only two different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if they could change the sperm and <unk> , or the newly <unk> egg in order to be a better chance to be a better chance to a life -- eliminating the diabetes , eliminate the <unk> , eliminate the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science can enable the changes to prevent disease , and enable us to adopt the disease , <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can expand the next generation of the <unk> ?
why not the fast <unk> have , they enable them to be faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these are being <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can share it to the next generation , and we want to adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can compress it to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions about their grandkids , or their grandkids , to be to be .
do we use these decisions to form that is better , the more friendly ?
or will we have a different attributes that we want to have to have to have to be the other from us ?
are we going to form a society , <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing .
and the lowest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom of the that we need to meet this decision ?
in the good like in the evil , and sooner than you think , these decisions are going to us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you <unk> skills , or another , the <unk> , helps to stand up and go back and go .
we call berkeley <unk> call these robots .
they &apos;re not something else than something that they put in the morning and give them extra strength and it will be further and it will be more and help you , for example , your balance .
it &apos;s actually the true of a <unk> and machine .
but not only that -- it &apos;s merge and connecting them with the universe and other <unk> .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s carrying about 100 pounds on his back and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this is a few major complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we would expect us to embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help with this problem with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to introduce the human human <unk> .
<unk> : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds of a <unk> terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to be moving down to the way to crawl and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and get my strength and perseverance .
we &apos;re far as far with our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> of this year .
so it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s now take our first step up to the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are under the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a young person with spinal cord injury that &apos;s in the height of their life -- -- &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 70s , the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , which is multiplied by the number of themselves .
and so the only option -- when it comes to a <unk> , or another complications -- is the wheelchair .
and this is how it has been for 500 years since the way i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a whole new chapter in the space of mobility .
now let me introduce you to you , this is the amanda <unk> , who had a <unk> , the last 19 years ago , the result that they haven &apos;t been working for 19 years and now .
thank you .
i said amanda , our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals at our <unk> , which is attached to the back of the back .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on its hip , as as in their <unk> , they move forward into this very <unk> and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , during a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and a movement of the <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
it &apos;s <unk> every <unk> of hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have taken me to come back to go back to go , and even to go to the hands .
but nothing was invented me , and now , again , now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the potential to change life -- not just for the military , or for amanda , and all the wheelchair , but for everyone .
thank you .
home in new york , i &apos;m boss the <unk> of an non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t include poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> , a volunteer <unk> .
now in our city , in our city , in the volunteers , the volunteers have to supported a <unk> of <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to be able to <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer , i had a good opportunity to be able to do .
but it was still a running against the other people to achieve the wards and to find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just a very serious conversation with the <unk> , certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and they stood down in the <unk> and a barefoot outside of a <unk> outside of rain in the rain , while their house was caught in flames .
the other volunteers , just to me , was a <unk> -- we call him a <unk> luther -- got the first time , and i was asked to go into the house and save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was <unk> , <unk> .
there was a lawyer or <unk> , who now for the rest of his life , who was going to tell people that he was going to be a <unk> house to save a living , except because he was five seconds faster than i .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped to me , i went to -- the ones , the corridor of the <unk> , the <unk> , which is so pretty finished , into the bedroom to get a few of the shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i carried my prey back to the bottom , where i met my <unk> and the loved dog .
we put our treasures out outside , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention to my own .
a few weeks later , the <unk> had a letter of the <unk> that she was trying to put their house for the brave deployment of their house .
one of all the unfortunate kindness : somebody had a few of the shoes .
and in my career , robin hood , as as as as as as i was in my <unk> as a 29 biologist , i am a <unk> of generosity and kindness on the great scale , but i also see the <unk> and the <unk> of the one .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i see myself in this room , and people see who either have a success success or their way there , i want to offer you feel like this : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t you wait for a difference in life , until you &apos;ve got their first million .
if you have something , you &apos;ll give it .
they feed them in a <unk> , room , in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we have a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day offers us the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
i <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just going to come back from a community that knows the secret of humankind .
a place where women have the <unk> , with sex words , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious deal .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their blood vessels .
this is the world of the wild bonobo in the congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living living .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived around about six million years ago .
well chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately we have this aspect of the aspect of human evolution in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the medal .
while chimpanzees , as chimpanzees , fear of the great , <unk> , the <unk> of the female females .
they really really got up with what that leads to a very popular society , in the lethal force .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known to primates .
they live in the depths of the <unk> , and the observation is just difficult to the .
congo is a paradox -- a country of remarkable biodiversity and beauty , but the heart itself -- the arena of a violent dispute that has been nearly as many life as the first world war i.
it doesn &apos;t surprise that this destruction also survive the survival of the bonobos .
<unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> is to do that you can &apos;t even fill a <unk> with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that the <unk> was shattered .
who are these related ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , with more <unk> partners , with more <unk> partners , and rules like this conflict and social <unk> .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos is made of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
game doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
and it &apos;s essential to us , and it &apos;s essential to the attachment relationship and the care of the tolerance .
and we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
it &apos;s mighty creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity on connections .
and when you &apos;re watching bonobos at the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t know how to play , but i want to show you some unique images from the wild .
first of a <unk> , i think , i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what they do .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she puts it in the egg . &quot;
i think it &apos;s just like it , it &apos;s not true .
yes !
so <unk> is spread , both bonobo people as well as humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the <unk> of the <unk> that you &apos;re doing new elements in the game -- -- how the testicles -- and also , how the game is both confidence in the same time .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take many shapes that some of them are quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to explore the surprise again .
and i want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and it &apos;s a <unk> peaceful with water .
i think exactly how they &apos;re playing , we &apos;re going to play ourselves , and we look at the <unk> boundaries of our inner and the outside worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that lets us explore and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we &apos;re creating are the real breeding breeding creativity .
this is just a little <unk> on the insights , the bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it also true also a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to the more unequal challenges , through greater creativity and more robust .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our <unk> .
to be successful in a hyper-connected world , we have to play .
but will we make the best out of our <unk> ?
game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for other bonobos and people alike are not made of teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be a game at the <unk> .
and so , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us to embrace this gift of evolution and play in the way we <unk> the creativity of <unk> and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to introduce you to two couples , middle 1979 , the same time , the same moment , every baby &apos;s baby -- okay .
so two couples , each <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to be too much time to imagine the <unk> , because if you imagine the whole time of the <unk> , you won &apos;t listen to me .
think that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm is carrying a y <unk> that &apos;s encoded on the x chromosome in the .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that meets the x chromosome in the .
both of them are <unk> , both light .
we &apos;ll get to these people back later .
i have two hats in the most of my activities .
i &apos;m a <unk> in a hat with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a study <unk> , and in this case i study how people with anatomy -- that means human body , animal bodies -- like it <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , and how you think about body .
the other hat i &apos;ve been carrying with my work is the activist , as a <unk> -- or , as i say , &quot; <unk> lawyer -- by people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have the <unk> of the social norms in question .
so i &apos;ve been working with people who are identical twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> -- so people who were being as common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with people who were <unk> , their gender <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term we can use the word of it .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i &apos;ll give you just a few examples of the kinds of <unk> that don &apos;t correspond to the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> leaves the <unk> , the <unk> , we all have to grow up to the testes .
and so , the testicles are <unk> testosterone .
but because this individual because this individual is missing the receptor to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to the testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so , a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a result , the body develops more of the hallmarks of female .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s raised as girls .
but it takes mostly until they reached puberty and their breasts and they develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone &apos;s coming up with it , until someone &apos;s a different .
and they do a few tests and find out that they &apos;re instead of <unk> and uterus , actually <unk> and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could hold this person for you to be the , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies , something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the posterior part of our body .
and the <unk> <unk> are <unk> , which are <unk> hormones .
most of the women , as i -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i &apos;ve probably the typical women -- most women , i think i &apos;m actually talking about <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the implication is that someone like me , in fact , a brain , when a woman who was born with testicles , and a <unk> .
so , gender is really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of sex -- in a sense , can be spread over the entire range of the range .
another example , a few years ago , i received the phone call a 19 , a boy , who was born as a boy , he had a friend , his girlfriend , lived as man , and he had just found that he was <unk> and one .
he had an extreme form of an innate <unk> .
it has <unk> chromosome , and in utero , his <unk> <unk> so strong , that they have essentially a male <unk> .
and as a result , his <unk> was <unk> in the brain , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he saw a boy -- no one could see a little of a -- no one .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually because he was inside the , the doctors found that he was in the inside of a female .
okay , just a quick example of a variant of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , something called <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why it &apos;s happening .
so , gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it <unk> or identical twins -- it &apos;s often adapted to the norm , is not because this is their physical health .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason why they often get different kinds of things that are , because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical is a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is to have to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this terribly <unk> idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body , which is actually something very different , <unk> us to be on these <unk> .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how it &apos;s what &apos;s it when children are born , the two people in a body .
and where i had had been most of the very last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , whose gender was asked in the <unk> world world in berlin .
many journalists were calling me with the question : &quot; what do you do , that tells us whether <unk> <unk> female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists , that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough to say that nature doesn &apos;t have the line between the male and female , or between the <unk> and a female and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , we are , we are the line of the line of this line than we do .
so we have a situation that we keep going on our science at the end , we have to recognize that these categories that we had to be supported for mild categories , which are very simple <unk> to create permanent <unk> , a lot more livable than we have .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it also also in terms of race , which was a lot more complicated than our <unk> has approved .
we &apos;re in the <unk> of our study , we &apos;re all kinds of <unk> areas .
so we &apos;re going to take the case in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through a few <unk> ?
and as we continue to continue our science , we get increasingly into a zone of the <unk> , where we recognize that the <unk> categories that we had probably are too easy .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas we see in the <unk> of the world &apos;s <unk> , in our culture today , the struggles of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what &apos;s a body will , so he &apos;s a different kind of self as a form of the .
we have very difficult conversations -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when somebody is dead .
our ancestors used to be the way earlier to fight when somebody was dead .
you have somebody kept a feather under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if they &apos;re not moving to it , you put them buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people to take people &apos;s organs and implant them .
and as a result , we were <unk> with the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and it &apos;s got to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categories .
now you may think that the whole thing was not happy to be happy from categories like me .
i &apos;m politically <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to admit , i nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i think .
and it makes me wonder in terms of democracy .
so to tell you from this <unk> , i have to leave the <unk> that i am a big fan of the founding founding .
i know that they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think they were so <unk> and strong , so radical , in what they did , i <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that is totally to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the <unk> .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they <unk> was a <unk> concept , and it was using it through another , that radical and beautiful and 200 years for us .
as you recall , our founding fathers , the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of the .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , that political power was supposed to be the political <unk> from the grandfather to son , son and so on .
so the founding founding nozzles back and replaced it through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all humans were being created with the same time .
they <unk> the playing , and they decided that <unk> , the commonality , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made it part because they were part of a <unk> system , in the two things in common .
it grew democracy , but at the same time , it grew up to science .
now , when you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s very clear that many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from the <unk> of the <unk> , and marshes things like a psychic concept of power , back to the , where the transmission in a very <unk> process of <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they were a concept of <unk> commonality .
and so they &apos;ve prepared it in a wonderful way the future rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that years after that ?
for example , women who used the <unk> <unk> , the concept of the founding founding , which says that there &apos;s an extraordinary common than the anatomical difference and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and <unk> , and said , &quot; that we should have a <unk> and <unk> , and it &apos;s not a difference in the same way that we should have , the right on full citizenship , etc .
and women <unk> successfully .
next next was the successful civil rights civil rights civil rights civil rights civil rights civil rights civil rights was like <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s about the <unk> <unk> , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of the <unk> , who say , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people are more different skin skin skin skin , are <unk> professions to be more precise , again , successful .
we see the same thing at the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at the commonality , we have to start to ask why we sustain certain <unk> .
now , mind , i &apos;d like to be able to sustain certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish for example , to a fish , as a fish .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should have to have your informed consent or marry your informed or to marry .
so there &apos;s some anatomic <unk> that make sense of sense of making sense , and we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to try to figure out what they are and why they keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so , let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that are being <unk> at the beginning of the speech .
we have two creatures , both middle 1979 , the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of you , maria , three months , she &apos;s born at a <unk> 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , it &apos;s born to the <unk> , he &apos;s born at one march 1980 .
just because , maria is three months of <unk> , you get all sorts of the right three months from <unk> -- that &apos;s right to have sex , which is right to drink .
<unk> has to wait for all this , because it &apos;s actually a different biological age , except because of the <unk> of its birth .
we find another <unk> in terms of what their rights are .
<unk> , you think that he &apos;s the male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with <unk> -- because you think he &apos;s the <unk> , it can now move into , which maria , which is the maria of a <unk> .
maria , however , in all states , can &apos;t see the same thing , the <unk> <unk> in all of the states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
<unk> can marry a woman , but maria can marry today in a few states , a woman .
so we have these permanent <unk> categories that are the many ways to be highly and questionable .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do that we &apos;re doing this progress in the realm of anatomy , we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy that could be in anatomy , <unk> ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science of its own .
so where are we going to go ?
it seems like our culture of a pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , texas , at a point decided that you don &apos;t have any y chromosome , and a woman to marry a woman , you have a coke chromosome .
now , in practice , people aren &apos;t tested in their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very strange because of the story i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> .
if we look at one of the founding founding of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us to his &quot; i &apos;m a dream of a a dream . &quot;
he says , we shouldn &apos;t be people , &quot; your skin color , but after the property of their character , &quot; and goes to judge the character of their character , and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , this sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how are people like people who are people based on their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to be so much for people to be so much because i have to admit , i have to say , i have a set golden <unk> that probably are more people than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i &apos;ve probably known some bright <unk> , the <unk> are more intelligent and more more than to meet their sexual relations than some <unk> i know .
so how are we supposed to be the question to the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out to be a really difficult .
and one part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be a little bit about the future of a personality -- using an fmri , could be done ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really important to think about the idea that the united states is to be concerned about questions about questions about how to make democracy .
in our effort in our effort in our effort , we &apos;ve done it right well , and i think we would make our things well .
we don &apos;t have the situation , as an example in iran , where a man who attracted to other who is being sexually drawn to other men who is punished , because he &apos;s willing to be a <unk> in which case he &apos;s case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
conditions that exist in that kind of .
i &apos;m happy to say that we haven &apos;t have these monkeys -- a surgeon i talked a few years ago , who had a couple of identical twins with <unk> to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he was doing these surgeries -- it was tall surgery , his answer was that these kids would be very bad treated , and so he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , have a drug <unk> , instead of having a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people who they are , without the way they have to change the state of the will .
and so i think , we need to be leaders .
well just to conclude , i want to realize i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the ways of how democracy might look like , or looked like , if we had the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that is radical a feminist to radical , and i think there may be different kinds of insight that are <unk> from different types of anatomy , <unk> when people use a <unk> .
for years , because i was interested in <unk> , i was interested in research in the field of interest .
and one of the things that i really interesting was is the difference between men and women in ways to think about how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not any , but on average -- is more complex social relations and care of people who are vulnerable in the group , very much more attention .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about this , we have an interesting situation .
so , when i did a graduate student , i was a <unk> of my favorite , i was thinking about feminism -- i looked as feminist , i think -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s female female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
it &apos;s the implication of the <unk> of gender , so on feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought , i thought there could be something that could be something .
it &apos;s supposed to be something , on average , and the average brains are different from the male &apos;s brains , for social relations , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers were very focused on finding how individuals before the state could be protected , it &apos;s possible that when we <unk> more mothers in this concept , we can &apos;t just how to protect , but how to be protecting it for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s what we have to go in the future , when we &apos;re talking about it , to think about the individual body -- less about the individual body to think about identity and more about relationships .
so that when we try to make a more <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you , what i &apos;m going to be a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to every chance to find another <unk> , crazy outfit , to be able to photograph and to photograph over the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand in <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> to the environment and also the <unk> .
i meet all kinds of great people , and they &apos;re calling for a good purpose ; i &apos;m looking pretty unique ; and it makes my personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
am i going to like color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers to say , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve got here at ted , for this exciting week .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very closely what i &apos;ve brought with .
i brought seven in my underwear and this is all .
<unk> for exactly a week is everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve gone to that i could wear everything else , if i was going to get into palm springs .
and since you haven &apos;t heard of me as the woman , who &apos;s in the ted -- that &apos;s the , i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;m just like to show you my <unk> for this week .
sounds that good ?
and while i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons i &apos;m going to believe or not , from these <unk> , nothing new to wear .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the glow tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look a great deal for less than 50 dollars .
and this is an outfit , including the coat , 55 , and it was the most expensive piece i &apos;ve got to this week .
monday , color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing your pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adapting , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
i spent very much time in my life , trying to be able to adapt to myself and adapt to the same time .
be just to be who they are .
if you surround yourself with the right people , they won &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;re sure it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes i say , people , i saw , &quot; i would like to do , or i remember her vaginas .
i like to smile , and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
<unk> : confidence is the key .
if you think , you look at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they &apos;re not good in something that you &apos;re not good , you &apos;re right now .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just recap that for you .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside and the outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anybody here in this audience here .
we should be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit into everything .
and finally , saturday , a sense , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about a to tell you about a word without having a word .
it was always been able to get back and again , when i got people to come to me , just because what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home brooklyn , i &apos;ll donate it all over .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go go .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally <unk> , because the the corner , it always gets another crazy , <unk> , <unk> outfit that just waiting for me , if i &apos;m a little love in my heart and search for .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a <unk> , as flying <unk> .
this is what we call <unk> design , design design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy is growing with this picture in italy with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that this is the formula one in the last decades .
so , a few time ago , if you wanted to win a formula one , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , you know , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that the car is in real time , some thousand sensors that are information from the car , and it and then use them to make this car and use them and use them and use them and use them into real time .
this would be , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is the <unk> start to come up in our lives .
our cities have been working with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to do computers in free .
and as computers in free , they start to react to other ways , and they &apos;re being rendered and driven .
when we zoom in , when we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities only two percent of the earth are earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
it &apos;s 75 percent of the <unk> -- that &apos;s going to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re doing something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense and turn into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that &apos;s paola , for moma later , during the summer , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to us to speak to us .
in a sense of sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out there is to two , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction that we have to have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo &apos;s spun by moses , he says he took the hammer , and he made him , and actually , you can still see a little spot , and i said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m going to show you just some examples -- again , to perceive our environment and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
let &apos;s see that with the sense .
so the first project i want to share is is one of the first of our lab .
it was a four and a half years ago .
and what we did was , actually , a new kind of network of using the network that has been used to the world -- this is a <unk> -- and anonymous and <unk> information from this network that are <unk> from the eyelids that are <unk> from the eyelids to understand how the city works .
and summer summer , a happy summer , in 2006 .
it was taken to the <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was playing in france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy , has won .
now , you see what happened on this day , just when the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s morning , before the game .
you see the time .
so in the early time , people here and there , and they &apos;re moving .
the game starts at -- silent silent .
france makes a gateway . italy , a gateway .
<unk> , people make a quick phone call , go to the bathroom .
second <unk> . the end of normal play .
first of fusion , second .
<unk> , in a moment of the <unk> .
italy . yeah .
now , in this night , all the to the center to celebrate .
they saw the great rash .
the next day , all the to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister to the same time .
and then all the bottom .
you see the image of the location of <unk> <unk> , where the the <unk> time , the people to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the most pessimistic end at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city now , in a way we couldn &apos;t have it a few years ago .
again , another example of this is , this is , here &apos;s not about people , but to consume things we use and consume .
now , now we know everything that we know about how to come .
this is a map that you &apos;re showing you the chips , which is a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so we &apos;ve actually designed some little markers in this project to track waste while through the system .
so we started with some volunteers , we &apos;ve been helped us to tag a year in seattle , the things that they &apos;re <unk> -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you might take away .
then we have the little chips , the little token , on the garbage and started track .
so here &apos;s the results we &apos;ve just got right now .
from seattle ...
after one week .
and with this information that we realized there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in doing with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of <unk> and complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not just disappear , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day , still it will still take away .
and if we &apos;re going to show that people , we can move a change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could you even more about this , and the many other wonderful things you can perceive with sense , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> spain .
it started with a question of the <unk> , and he said to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were in a <unk> <unk> , , imagine that tubes , and the grubs , <unk> , valves , and they &apos;re opening up and close .
it &apos;s a lot of what a <unk> <unk> with water .
when these <unk> fall , you can write it , you can , images , images , text ads .
and you can get to it , and he &apos;s going to open to you to make you look at them , as you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of <unk> .
it &apos;s very like it very .
and we got to a assignment to design the the the the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you get to him , it will open and it &apos;s going to get them .
the roof was covered with water .
and when it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce it , you can even the roof .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is , like in this case , you know , this one , this one , that you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they have ruined the building . &quot;
no , they have no the building , it &apos;s only the architecture disappears away .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who says what &apos;s happening inside .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not get wet .
now i should tell you what one night was going to be about all of the aerodynamic , and all these sensors .
but actually , it was a little bit more fun .
all the children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building , very different .
no longer a building that would open to you , but a building that still breaks and still and holes in water , you had to jump out without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beautiful thing about creating things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the water dioxide out of water and the projections on it .
and this is what we &apos;ve got to think about this project , i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine these <unk> , they could really start to fly .
imagine , you could have a little helicopter that fly through the air , and each of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the , you saw earlier , that &apos;s perfectly in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or display like this -- a <unk> formations in two dimensions .
or pete , but infrequently , in three dimensions , where what &apos;s changing , the light is not the position of the <unk> .
you can play with different kinds of different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different <unk> or sizes , in different <unk> .
but then it could just be a 3d cloud of <unk> that you can go to and through that they move through that they can move through many of many directions .
here you see a real <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to form a <unk> crossing .
and when you turn the light on , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person &apos;s being used .
it may every single one of a single <unk> to a impulse that comes from people to be the movements of people or whatnot .
i want to show you something about this .
we &apos;ve worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> on the metropolitan theater , and we have its movements in <unk> , and we use his movements in 3d to use them as a impulse for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> impressions .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have the <unk> , they can play with color gravity and play with color gravity .
and we want to use this as a sort of impulse for the <unk> .
so i want to share with you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re doing people to do something and changing the environment -- almost as something like we call it , <unk> , and it &apos;s a cloud .
imagine that every one a few donation can be a <unk> for a <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable thing about the years last decades , the last decades is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
this has all been digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s available to the internet .
nowadays , we can go to the first time -- and the campaign president has shown -- we can change from the digital world from the <unk> forces of the world to the physical world .
it can be , in our case , we use it to design and a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us to the challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually actually have the people involved in the , and they &apos;re collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , a cloud is a cloud of particles in the same way .
and these haze particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical feature in london , but with <unk> <unk> .
they can move inside and different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments of <unk> and more sharing and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of the top of the new <unk> .
you can get inside .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience of the experience of all the things that want to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i think of the context is very important .
and through my work , i try to express , that people are separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first <unk> .
i looked at awe awe .
my heart hit , i was <unk> while i was trying to figure out what was me .
the <unk> <unk> around me almost 60 feet almost feet from the water , and i was just looking at awe that this was a snowflake , year year .
<unk> is born as a calf of a glacier or by <unk> out of <unk> .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with clear ways with their own environment and their experience .
some rebel and they &apos;re <unk> and <unk> , to the bitter end , whereas others can &apos;t withstand it and in a <unk> dramatic amount of passion .
when you look at a graph , you think it &apos;s very isolated , separated , and just as we see people often see .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg melting , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
and as the iceberg melt melt , it puts water water free to make a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to my footage of this sort of <unk> , like i was living portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they have been in these individual moments , and never come again .
it &apos;s not death when it melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of your <unk> running along the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the <unk> <unk> , i &apos;m very young -- a few thousand years old .
and one part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
so the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a graph that i put in <unk> in greenland in greenland .
very rarely in fact , you will witnessing a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please , please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it stands about 120 feet of water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , you show you a different side of the picture of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and this was the outbreak of the death .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes still .
i stood up with him .
i have a company that &apos;s design and animations , which is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the world world .
so we decided to be tony -- <unk> -- and support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to say to him , and i said , &quot; wait for me , is that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t be able to communicate any paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he answered , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about the higher <unk> , and a remarkable insurance , you can actually do it .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate with you ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re running along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came with the need to just a check , and instead i put a check from me , i didn &apos;t know the smallest idea how i should be .
i &apos;m committing to place and ask him to his brother and his father -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony &apos;s going to be , we &apos;ll find him a device and we &apos;ll find a way to find a and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do it again .
because it &apos;s an adaptation , someone who &apos;s still carrying it into itself , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i talked a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , and the research lab and they have a technology that allows you to put a light on any surface , and then you like to draw a <unk> on it , which only the negative surface is reported .
so they &apos;re moving around and make <unk> like this .
they say , all things that are going up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the testes , then the <unk> , the <unk> and the end , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife and and i was using , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , when there &apos;s this technology , and you can use his eyes to taxes , and then we can make a way to raise things , and then we can make a way to raise things that it would be brilliant .
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot and a lot of things , we have done some things .
one , we have the insurance <unk> , and actually , for a machine , and actually , for a device that can communicate with -- a stephen <unk> .
it was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extreme -- i call it <unk> because you &apos;re talking to him , or you get an e-mail , and thinks like , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is unbelievable . &quot;
and then we have seven <unk> <unk> from the entire world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
so many of our friends thought we were beautiful dumb , and we were <unk> and all the images on the walls were <unk> <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to <unk> in venice , my children , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought in the <unk> of venice , a little bit of <unk> and some stuff from the hardware hardware and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , and we have a <unk> that &apos;s free , and we can build it yourself -- you can build it yourself , we put it in free , we can download the code free for free , the software , you can download for free .
so we created a device that &apos;s completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be <unk> .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so the end of two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of someone else and this is his room .
so there &apos;s all this <unk> of the great revelation of the great revelation .
and after a year , planning , two weeks , <unk> and <unk> nights , <unk> , <unk> , for the first time seven seven years .
and this is a amazing picture , because this is his life life system , and he sees his life life system .
we have gone down to bed so that it can see outside .
we have a projector on a wall of the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of this was in the parking lot .
and we also had to be able to put in the parking lot of times , we felt like a part of the <unk> .
and then he &apos;s going to send us an e-mail with this : &quot; for the first time seven years i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel like i was going to hold underwater , and finally , and then put my head up , and i &apos;d breathe my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
it keeps us to stick and and we continue to develop .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing contraption , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
and someone who has such a potential potential potential , it deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re in the way to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
we &apos;ve been given all of the <unk> of recognition .
we won a few awards .
think it &apos;s free , no one of us deserve it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so , the more than the , , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> about us , and then , in december , the most exciting innovation was honored to than one of the 50 major inventions in 2010 .
the <unk> is this -- and this includes the whole circle -- that this april , the <unk> <unk> in the city downtown of los angeles , is a show called &quot; art of the <unk> &quot;
and there may be so much the toughest representative of the <unk> activists -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys will be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty much .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you look something that &apos;s impossible , then i can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , this microphone -- everything that was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never been doing something with <unk> , but i just just surrounded myself with amazing people , so we could put something on the legs so we could put something on the legs .
and this question would each of you , and that &apos;s every single day of you , and that makes you something that needs to be done , if not now , when i don &apos;t , when i do , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably the most of america &apos;s mostly <unk> .
and i say the people i don &apos;t tell people like a scientist , so i want to say .
you can have as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever chosen farmers .
i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
now , a epiphany is , usually something that you find it somewhere in there .
you go to the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a beach .
one of my friends , it was -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated material that i want to share with you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one who &apos;s a week in the <unk> green and blue , until a teacher rescued my life .
she rescued my life by taking the toilet in the <unk> .
it did it secretly .
it did it for three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was <unk> to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to be a work at <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i received the middle of the night , a call from this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad , we never learned another as adults .
can you ask to ohio , and please come along with the man i know they &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i &apos;m going to have , and i want you to get a quick . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we were laughing , we were laughing , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we were caring for them , and we gave them their family eight , because it was necessary to be able to do .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who was when i was when adults know , to know , she turned into a box of kilimanjaro and got into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was closed , and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she rescued my life , and my partner and i have my own .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that &apos;s going to take the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned .
it needs it -- it takes love , love and pleasure and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a large explosion , while they &apos;re going to be on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane , you have a plane full smoke .
imagine a motor engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this sounds fear <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> .
so i looked at it right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we may have caught some of the birds . &quot;
the pilot had already been <unk> , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the the hudson river .
it usually doesn &apos;t the route .
it switches on the engines .
imagine a little plane &apos;s plane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the ground . &quot;
i had to talk to the more talk to the <unk> .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was too end .
so i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this <unk> , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to find a hand , and it didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to do , and i was going to make all the things that i wanted and never did .
while i thought later , i noticed a phrase , which is , &quot; i &apos;m gonna kill bad bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is far as far as the , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move more .
and this urgency , this goal , my life has really changed .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we <unk> george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing i really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i <unk> , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given to the other of my own ego .
and i <unk> the time i wasted for <unk> things , with people who are doing something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , people .
and then when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i &apos;m not two years to my wife , i was <unk> .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right now ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and as the inside of the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please , please , in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to 20 pieces , as you know it from a documentary .
as we <unk> , i had this feeling , man , man , is not terrifying .
almost like we would prepare for our lives for us for the way .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this is really unfortunate <unk> , in one thought , is that i just wishes to do one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a <unk> my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
don &apos;t .
and i <unk> , i don &apos;t care like a little kid .
and in the world , it made a sense of me .
i was realized at the time , by the dots that i was just about the dots that it &apos;s just about a great father &apos;s about being a great father .
more than everything , it &apos;s my single goal in life , a good man in life .
i was given the wonders of the wonder that day .
i received another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and to live differently .
my call to all of you who are flying today , is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- please — — but what they &apos;re doing , and how would you change ?
what would they do it , because they think they were always there for forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents who can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty easy .
we don &apos;t want the bomb to build the bomb .
the most important thing there is <unk> , the <unk> of weapons is the <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we can now , the systems are too <unk> , which is <unk> and the floors , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these pockets are not running with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , an effective <unk> on a laptop , which is used by a <unk> <unk> , to <unk> this grey box of <unk> , then we &apos;re in the store .
and this is the planning behind the <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> will be in the grey box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
when we began to <unk> our research , six months ago , was completely unknown , what was the sense of purpose and purpose of this .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated to the most <unk> part , the <unk> part , it made by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed something <unk> , with these <unk> boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of our attention and we started a <unk> project where we were infected with the environment with the <unk> , and we investigated this construct .
and then something bizarre happened .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like a <unk> , which our cheese didn &apos;t like to be -- <unk> , but wouldn &apos;t eat it .
that made no sense of my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to to think that this was a <unk> attack .
totally <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> active active on the gray box , if a particular configuration was discovered , even if the special program that you &apos;re trying to get infected on this goal .
and if not , don &apos;t get anything at all .
so , that really , my interest , i really got my interest and we started working with it almost about the clock , because i thought , well we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , for example , a <unk> american power power , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so , <unk> and <unk> , we put the <unk> code and found that it &apos;s <unk> in two digital warheads -- a smaller and one bigger one .
and we also realized they were very advanced , by people who had all the <unk> information .
they knew any bits and <unk> that they had to attack .
probably the <unk> of the <unk> , they know the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech high-tech , let me tell you : the <unk> is a science for themselves .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than everything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code code .
we &apos;re talking about 15,000 lines code code .
it looks pretty much like an outdated <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we could be able to get out of this code .
so after first , we were looking for , <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is .
and then we looked at <unk> and <unk> and and trying to connect this with the real world , with potential destinations in the world .
so we need to have theories about these targets that we &apos;ve been able to prove or it .
to make these theories , we call ourselves in mind that it &apos;s definitely about <unk> <unk> , it has to be a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because there are most infections .
well , in this area , there are not a few of a thousand targets .
it &apos;s basically running out on the <unk> nuclear waste , and it &apos;s on the <unk> of <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m taking a list of all experts on <unk> and plants plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them and <unk> her knowledge to compare to the compare to compare to what we found in the code and the data .
and it worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the rotor is that moving into a <unk> , this black object that you see .
and when you tamper with the speed of this <unk> , you can actually crack the rotor and even even the <unk> to explode the centrifuge .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , to slow and <unk> -- obviously in trying to despair in trying to despair , so they &apos;re not able to get to it , and they would quickly be able to get quickly behind it .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a look at the very closely and looked at it very closely and <unk> .
so for example , the number <unk> is going to be very from this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i began to <unk> scientific literature , and as these <unk> were built in <unk> and found out that they &apos;re <unk> in the so-called <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it adapted .
and it was even better .
these <unk> <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s a almost identical structure .
so again , this is really good at all .
and this gave us great confidence for this , we looked at this .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
these results were achieved by several weeks .
and we often ran a <unk> and we had to get to <unk> .
but anyway , we found that both of the digital warheads in the <unk> is actually on a and the same goal , but from different directions .
so the little <unk> takes over the <unk> , and <unk> the and down the <unk> and down the big <unk> , with six <unk> in interaction and manipulated them .
so , in the big , we &apos;re very confident that we &apos;ve actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about other targets that other targets are being made of <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- has made me <unk> .
there &apos;s the gray box there , and on top you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is going to make it is that the forces of sensors -- so for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s <unk> code for the time that attack with the wrong attack , with the wrong with the wrong .
and in fact , this is the wrong covering data is already taken from <unk> .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where during the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not only the <unk> control control .
in fact , it &apos;s more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is to cheat a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> , where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough enough .
so in a power station for example , when the large <unk> is too fast , you have to open up <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so , in this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if the danger is , you can actually happen very bad things .
this is a <unk> power .
and neither the <unk> , nor the <unk> will notice .
it &apos;s frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he doesn &apos;t have nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so he would work for for example , in a power station or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a stick stick to stick on a <unk> stick , as we saw it in the <unk> .
you could also use ordinary information technology to the state .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the implication we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they lie in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most integrated environments .
we have to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of that that people think that the <unk> is the <unk> .
is that what your mind is ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my view is involved in the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately , happiness .
because it would be the problem of the even bigger .
thank you for a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last couple years of the time , to place in situations that normally are kind of dangerous and the same time .
i went to prison -- difficult .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing to eat this -- they &apos;re doing some of a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most part of my career from <unk> situations , and it &apos;s all the trying to study that , and i think , and i hope to understand what they &apos;re compelling and interesting to a way that they make for the audience and <unk> and it .
so when i knew that i would come to come here to look at a tedtalk from the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i have a display on ebay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent out some <unk> , some <unk> , and i have the opportunity to <unk> the ted <unk> in my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , and the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never going to be able to buy the talk -- the <unk> of that there was no lot of content and not a lot of evidence that the subject was supposed to be .
so what you got was , this is what you name here : my name here : my tedtalk , who you have no idea what the subject will be , and the one of them to be the ears , especially if i let her company , for their involvement .
but it &apos;s time , it &apos;s a very good opportunity to it .
you know how many people look at this tedtalks ?
a lot of lots .
this is just the way of the <unk> .
so despite this , , despite this , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
so if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say to you with certainty .
but in the new project , i work on my new film , we study the world of marketing , the commercials .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone over the course of the years in some pretty awful lot , but nothing could prepare for anything that was so difficult and how dangerous , to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is <unk> by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s going to &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from the top up to the end , totally with a little bit , it &apos;s -- by the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand <unk> <unk> .
now this brand , the <unk> stadium , the <unk> center ...
these guys are connected to stay in infinity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- this is what ? in infinity forever ?
i am a <unk> person .
that was more for the accent .
it was &quot; stay in infinity forever .
but we &apos;re not just going to just be the brand x as a <unk> , but we &apos;re sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we may sell a shoe , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you ever wore ...
the greatest car that they ever ever the dangers , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had a <unk> of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that tokens are part of the life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of it as it works .
the goal of all is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing on the film .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would look like to be able to help the help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; button , because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how to evolve ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
a million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth the case that some really really known to be .
who knows when the film comes out , we may see like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
and the answer is probably the answer is no .
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing about me ?
jk : both .
so , so optimistic , it means you &apos;re not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what tokens .
yes .
if you look at people , you know , to look at the people that they have to do .
there are some places that we can turn to us .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , &quot; what the camera would mean that we wanted to take a <unk> .
it turned out that it was really meant to be , &quot; we want to do with their film . &quot;
and just as the <unk> disappeared , one after the other .
no wanted to have to do with the film .
i was astonished .
they wanted to do nothing with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept of advertising was to be able to present your product as many people as possible to be able to present your product as many people as possible .
in the world &apos;s world , at this interface , on this interface , and the <unk> environment -- is it not the idea in this new exciting <unk> that makes the mass of this cause .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a <unk> mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this is , what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you look at transparency , you &apos;re in the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your kind sergey , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , and it just understood , and <unk> by <unk> and access to information , especially , <unk> , and the last line is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to come to it , it &apos;s going to be implemented .
but why ? well , transparency is fear <unk> -- like this strange bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is even risky ?
a whole shell of cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father was lying -- and there &apos;s me and looked at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of each story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the actual version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only a company , a agency , a agency , to help us -- and also only because i know john bond and richard <unk> &apos;s years -- i found that i had to do it , i had to deal with the <unk> and go directly with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand , or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is , a broad problem .
i have friends who are great , giant <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> i do .
and my friends , the great , enormous <unk> , say that the reason their films are so successful at the <unk> of the <unk> that you have .
and then my friends say , my friends , the little <unk> are , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how are we going to see you &apos;re going to see a <unk> in the movie ?
whenever i do it , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;ll see you &apos;re going to see you &apos;re going to see .
and every time i &apos;m , if i &apos;m a person , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re far ? they &apos;re going to look a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down to calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
either &quot; <unk> fusion &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the vote .
we &apos;re being equipped with men as women , they &apos;re <unk> -- stuck , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now i can give you the questions and give you an abridged version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you talked about the other other movies , we &apos;re as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other tokens .
so , so these things are doing -- you know , it &apos;s about automobiles -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to you ?
<unk> is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way you describe something that someone does under the <unk> .
so we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this particular is really to something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three <unk> .
so these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is how i , <unk> .
i want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand .
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i love to be nice clothes .
woman : &apos; 80s , <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style of style , i think , is &quot; glamour glamour &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of <unk> and stuff like this .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and this stuff .
woman : if dan would be a brand , it &apos;s probably a classic mercedes mercedes .
man 2 : the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman 2 : a comet , part of the <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man # : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> throughout the country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the <unk> , but i &apos;m often seeing the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed that i needed a expert .
i needed someone to go into my head , someone who really could really help me understand what you call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have firms like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for the , they could help me .
they brought their pictures , and they ?
i have . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit , how to tell your thoughts and emotions about it yourself .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world that you live -- how people are living -- how people are friends , the family , the way you live life , work and so forth .
all of these things come and start from a place and start to come with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the nicest day of my life .
what is the relationship to the mind and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queer . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you bring us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? in which <unk> are you &apos;re right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , they &apos;re not .
what else they have more <unk> have gone through ?
now , this is not being frightened . in what kind of rollercoaster are they ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for their patience .
yeah . well . well .
yes , i don &apos;t know what to come out of it .
there was a very many crazy things .
the first thing i saw was that their <unk> are two separate , but the <unk> pages has -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / <unk> brand .
the tie is very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction that .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re not afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re actually going to be , and they turn them into something positive , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> , and it &apos;s actually a <unk> .
what else does do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it , <unk> , wii , mini <unk> and <unk> .
now there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe their <unk> , how would they be ?
you you a <unk> ? they &apos;re something that makes blood in <unk> ?
or are they more likely a <unk> ?
are you something that little quiet , <unk> , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are <unk> , fresh like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , magical and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you more mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , like oprah ?
are they <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and in the course of film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and <unk> and the ones who were going to say , &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted to do anything with this film because they don &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but then , the <unk> of 17 <unk> , the ready to dispense these control , and make a <unk> , and accuse people , and i ended up to tell stories that we don &apos;t have to tell us -- stories that ordinarily would never have to be supportive of the stories that would ordinarily never have to be supportive .
they &apos;re <unk> to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising as well .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
there &apos;s been no <unk> for five years , no , no , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school school , where companies are going to go in the middle schools , in the very different america .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the most of whom i got the greatest success , those are , where i interacted with things directly with things .
and that &apos;s what these tags do these tokens .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think about the world &apos;s challenges .
and how did it be ? what it successful ?
now , since the film was first going to launch the film festival , we can see this time .
and so , according to the first time , the first thing ever since -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there was a million <unk> of this film .
it actually actually only one of a five- to a two weeks .
this is just online -- not press , no press .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no one thing that there is no <unk> . no <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to come out there .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project , almost every single <unk> that we talked about their clients , who have the fingers of it .
something that i find is that if you take your chance of the possibility , the risks that you &apos;re going to be in these risks .
i think , if you keep people from it , you get them to get them .
i think if you train your employees to avoid risks , you have to prepare the whole company for you to win a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage to make people to take risks .
we need to encourage people , not afraid of options who might be <unk> .
finally , in the course , we should be to be the fear of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to fear . welcome to jeopardy .
one of a big taste of a commodity , so we &apos;re welcome to risk .
and finally , we should welcome to the .
today , more than ever before , it &apos;s a little bit of honesty .
and this is said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get to them by my good friends of <unk> , who <unk> dollars for the <unk> for ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
<unk> : &quot; they &apos;re welcome to transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going to be done with the $ $ 100 laptop ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my bag , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check at altitude of dollars to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i <unk> to make something with museums and art , my favorite <unk> , which is also , i gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the table .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education in the -- i didn &apos;t know -- but i had no access to many museums and this works of art .
when i went traveling and i went to these galleries , i started to learn a lot to learn .
and while i worked for google , i tried to make this desire -- art exercise -- with technology to lead .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to go to <unk> .
you can be around this museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , which is the moma , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m even in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of the modern museum of art .
you get in two because of it -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they &apos;re -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and they are .
they want to be <unk> in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to be to the end of the gangs .
just on . so much fun .
try and look around .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so now i am one of my favorite <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum gave us the picture , click it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i click this now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve got with the so-called <unk> .
this picture of this picture has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get to be 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you .
you can get very easily and <unk> .
you can see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they want to really want to be in .
and so i started playing around and i realized there &apos;s something that goes there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , this sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the , and i realized that these kids actually would put it into .
i was a little bit , i talked to some familiar with some familiar with the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , which is a goose on the <unk> with a stick .
it seems to be very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
so to get close to the very close , you can go to the bathroom .
just to give you the track , i &apos;ll see you what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best part comes to -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump at at the moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
so previous example , it was about finding the details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what happens when you want to see van gogh this masterpiece because of this masterpiece , because they have created this masterpiece because of this masterpiece ?
you put in it . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in my <unk> &apos;s this picture , until i really am a suitcase .
this is <unk> , i think , you know , ever before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s another one more , but i &apos;ve missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s the collections of the .
everybody of you , everybody -- the same -- the same or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and online , you get to their own museum -- from all these images can make their own collection .
just simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s the power of the <unk> -- you can <unk> .
this is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all with fun , your friends , and so a conversation begin to what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful stuff is not from google .
you can &apos;t come to my own museums .
i may not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience of humility to me .
i mean , i hope that we are just doing with this digital medium of art , and they represent properly online .
and this is the biggest question that i recently said , &quot; did you make the experience of a <unk> of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can split into two halves .
this is the left half of the left that the <unk> page is and then the right half , the most intuitive page .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of any hemisphere , we could be able to represent your brain .
for example , this one person , this is the ultimate logic .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intuitive .
now , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been to one of these extremes , but i think that &apos;s what most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , the same time in both <unk> .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or anything .
it can be logically and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people , in conjunction with most of the <unk> experimental <unk> , which is a good set of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to do the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play it and look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they &apos;re doing the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing at the same time is just to be a place at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange to think that a thing at the same time is to two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed .
i remember playing a child playing on a <unk> .
he was still a toddler and not very good at it , and it fell down .
but i bet it to play with the <unk> of a very valuable lesson , which is the big stuff that you can &apos;t just get over , and they stay on one .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long , they &apos;re not a <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little curious particles .
and when you play with their particles , you ask all kinds of weird things -- like they fly right through walls , or that they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they would write these these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the kind of the physics of the physics , a few years ago ; you took quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particle .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great little bit of objects around us .
this has a intuition , my intuition is not like , and that &apos;s not because i don &apos;t play with particles .
well , i &apos;m games , i don &apos;t play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t like it .
because if all these things are made up , and all these particles , the rules of quantum mechanics , then wouldn &apos;t just be able to follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it should not be like this .
so i would know better with the whole thing , if we somehow show that the rules of quantum mechanics are following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , i was doing this .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see , that was in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a little computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is an image of the object .
and here i &apos;ll zoom out there . we &apos;re looking at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really very large close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a springboard and it &apos;s about the edge above .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all the big .
so for the last thing i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a <unk> pool , <unk> hole and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> of the <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it &apos;s going to be a full elevator ?
i mean , when i &apos;m on the elevator alone , i &apos;ll get all kinds of odd things and then you get to get to all these things , and i hear all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it , or , frankly , it &apos;s , frankly , it &apos;s , frankly , it &apos;s <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects are just as well .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only people , but the light that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s coming to them by the <unk> and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal was <unk> , we had to <unk> all the <unk> out .
and we did that .
we put the light off , put it into a vacuum and <unk> the whole air , and it &apos;s almost to the right now , it was the piece of metal , and it was like always to act like it .
so we measured its movement .
we found it really moved .
instead of just it &apos;s just there , it &apos;s just like this , it &apos;s like this -- like this -- like this -- like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and we put on a little push to vibrate at the same time , we could not -- -- something that &apos;s allowed to vibrate -- something that &apos;s just allowed in quantum mechanics .
so , what i &apos;m just telling you about is what truly fantastic fantastic .
what does it focus for a time to vibrate at the same time , and not relative ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms are from the little metal , still there and the same time , these are the same atoms and down .
just to accurate expandable voices , you &apos;re facing .
the rest of the time is they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that each atom has to be two different places , which is at the same time , is that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year into the clean space , because , check this , the <unk> between one atom and this piece of metal is about just like the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be at the same time at the same time to two different places , and then why don &apos;t you do it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time at the same time , how would they feel like this ?
how would your mind to deal with that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
and when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected with everything .
now , this is not quite right .
there &apos;s more beyond it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and this is the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in the year , in 2007 , i decided we should think about economic development .
it should be our goal , that when families think about , where they want to live and work , you want to be given to be a hand full of different cities that all in the competition to be different people .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which are not even a single city to the , which she would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs them .
so we could just the world very easily with <unk> , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may be absurd for you , if you never have thought about new cities .
but they just take the building of apartments on the cities .
imagine , half of the people who want to live in in their homes , this already , but the other half doesn &apos;t .
you could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what they would be about to be in these apartments and their environment to avoid grievances and to distract the <unk> .
so it turns out to be a very difficult to get all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new carbon filter , assuming the laws that would support and not treated .
so i proposed to governments to create new spaces that have enough place for a city and have given them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> about the challenge of reform in the challenge .
they knew that every year was going 75,000 <unk> of their country to be <unk> in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to ensure that these people can stay in their country and do the same in the same .
and at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we <unk> a <unk> area of our country , what if we simply get them to a message , one of the american embassy , a part of the <unk> , and when people want to work in the canadian rules , and when people want to work in the canadian rules , and when people want to work in the canadian rules , and when people want to work in the canadian rules , and when people want to work in the canadian rules ,
in the summer in 2009 , the <unk> of the fierce <unk> .
in the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , the program , and the <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to be <unk> .
in the meantime , i was in a <unk> talk to tedglobal .
in improving , try and through the study of the study , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the city of the <unk> city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you have already not to be able to <unk> existing <unk> .
we pay attention to new technologies , but for progress , it &apos;s the to be laws and laws , and they &apos;re usually laws that are <unk> .
in the autumn in 2010 , a friend from guatemala <unk> , the link to the tedtalk .
and again , it was <unk> .
the two <unk> started me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so , we met in december of the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make it clear , how much are cities , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york . think it &apos;s a area in some cases per square meter worth worth per square of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a break , <unk> , &quot; paul , may we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk turned into very simple form , that a <unk> city is a place , which is a <unk> , which is a <unk> , which the laws that defines the there and the people who offers the opportunity to live , either amongst these rules or not .
so , i was asked by the president of the , i said , to make this project , that it &apos;s important to bring our country to our country .
i was asked to <unk> , and i once to hold a lecture on the four- and fifth january .
so i thought another with facts <unk> &apos;s talk about how this involves this involves what , if you &apos;re going to make a lot of value in a city , it needs a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport , which was built in <unk> .
but at this airport alone has a 100 <unk> of the time .
so i &apos;m trying to convince the <unk> of it , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very seriously and attention .
the head of congress came up on the stage , and i said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we may look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and you played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line , a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in the , , instead of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders to have a .
the leaders of the government in the <unk> would be <unk> on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , and they would support that everybody can trust this , that everybody can &apos;t be able to have any that <unk> .
and the insight of president <unk> was that the confidence of the <unk> of the <unk> that i thought about as a way to build the foreign investors and to build this town for all of fear and mistrust for many years of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this is a picture of this place .
it just <unk> a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , the 19th of january , you voted to the <unk> of the constitution to have a <unk> control , which is for special <unk> .
in a country that has been a tough crisis in the congress , in congress , for these <unk> <unk> to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supported this .
to get part of the constitution , it has to be approved to congress .
on the 17th , it was authorized to a second time with <unk> .
immediately after this choice , between the 21st and february of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> of about 30 <unk> of the world that most of us were interested in the business of the <unk> .
it &apos;s a place in south korea .
this is a picture of a big new urban core , which is built in south korea , <unk> <unk> .
everything you can see on this picture , within four years , after it took four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was very active in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s already two cities in china and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re in a sense of it , you know , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a <unk> , and it &apos;s just consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that allows to be involved , and it &apos;s also working on a external system .
a country has already offered to the supreme court as a dish for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> .
it &apos;s also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they actually get funding with a .
one thing you know , it has already been , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are many companies that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who would like to live in there .
there &apos;s 700 million people who say they would like to live in a different place to another place .
a million people have a every year every year , and go to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to go to their families , and they &apos;re at <unk> , sometimes , <unk> , <unk> , who have enough money to earn food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents , they were in some cases , for a decade , for a decade .
so what &apos;s it to be a idea of thinking about this in all the way to do in all the way in all of the way to do .
or even <unk> to build these cities , or to get hundreds of all around the world ?
so what &apos;s it for an idea that every family has a choice between many cities who are in competition to new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends , my friends , i said to say , thank ted .
you know how many decisions do you make a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i recently made a survey with over 2,000 americans and the average number of decisions that are <unk> a typical americans on a day is <unk> <unk> .
and also , recently , a study of ceos made a study of ceos where they saw a week for the time .
and these scientists just documenting the different topics , and that would be engaged , and how much time they make decisions about the issues that are related to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo was busy doing with <unk> tasks .
each of these issues , of course , many smaller decisions .
fifty percent of their decisions are in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions required it an hour or more time .
think about their own decisions .
you know how many decisions you &apos;re in the nine minutes to the one in the nine minutes ?
how good , think they &apos;re doing to do the decision ?
today i want to talk about one of the greatest <unk> of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , i &apos;m blind , just your hand if you want to burn some calories .
so , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very very very , very , very , very , was really exclusive .
it was a store , the <unk> &apos;s called it .
this is a lot like a <unk> .
they had 250 different types of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time we &apos;ve actually been <unk> .
i loved it to this store , but i was at a time , i &apos;m wondering , well , how come you never to do anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had been about 75 different kinds of oil , including those who were locked in cabinets , the <unk> came up from a thousand years .
so i decided to visit the leader one day , and i asked the director , &quot; works this model that you really have to provide people all these capabilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists that came and they were usually their cameras in the same .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a little <unk> directly at the entrance entrance .
we put six different flavors of <unk> , or 24 different flavors of <unk> , and we &apos;ve got two things , first , i think , what would be more people and are going to be able to be able to try and try and try ?
it &apos;s more people who are staying , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were more likely to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and from the people who stayed when it was 24 , they were only three percent of them to <unk> .
so from the people who are sitting when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of them .
well , if you calculate it , the people bought six times a glass of <unk> , who they had six to the choices than when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that the <unk> of the <unk> is affecting us very much more powerful decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it &apos;s our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day , save a financial .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we were <unk> the decisions for the retirement of the <unk> of about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the <unk> , who was a <unk> of the <unk> plan , the <unk> plan , the chance of whether it &apos;s saving for tomorrow .
and we found that there was something that was actually there .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that offered the people between two to the number of two to the <unk> fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered to be the involvement .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans that delivers two fund , a <unk> in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that &apos;s almost 60 fund , the <unk> is now about the <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even if you were to get involved in , when you were to get the choices , even then , it has consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more likely to have the more powerful to be more and fund it to vote for free and fund .
the more opportunities to give them , the more they would have their entire money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that people recommend the future improve well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three basic negative consequences that provide the more and more choices .
they &apos;re the decision to do -- they &apos;re on , even if it &apos;s the interest against your own self-interest .
they make more significantly more significantly decisions -- much more likely to make health care .
they &apos;re more likely to do things that they &apos;re less happy , even if they make it objective .
the main reason for this is that we may be able to take away this huge set of shelves , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we don &apos;t actually compare to compare and diversity and then we can choose something like that fantastic offering .
so what i want to give you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and on different kinds of dna -- they can just apply them in their business .
first of all , just like it .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less than that is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry they lose <unk> .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if they &apos;re willing to limit and the <unk> of the opportunities , now , there &apos;s a increase increase , it &apos;s going to be a increase increase , it will be <unk> , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a improvement in <unk> .
as a <unk> and gamble of the various head and <unk> <unk> from 26 to 15 , and then it has 10 percent increase by the cost of 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation , her 10 to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you &apos;d actually have the profits to 87 percent of the <unk> -- a result of the two , and the increase of the two , we have to be increasing and reducing the cost of the cost of reducing .
you know , the average <unk> is today , you give you 45,000 about the average of you .
the typical portland is a typical walmart gives you a 100,000 products .
but the most <unk> supermarket , which is now <unk> supermarket in the world &apos;s <unk> , and they &apos;re just giving them a 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in cans .
now in the world of the <unk> , i think one of the greatest examples that came recently in the market , how to the best choices , was something that david <unk> has very strong <unk> , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single brazilian harvard employees is automatically to be <unk> in a <unk> .
those who really want to make a choice , they &apos;re offered to be 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it .
it &apos;s all important ways . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if you can &apos;t <unk> them , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
now before we have a meeting today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said , he said , he was willing to offer all the people in this audience , to offer a <unk> vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you to read .
and now i &apos;ll give you a couple of seconds to you , and then i urge you to clap , if you &apos;re ready with gary &apos;s offering .
okay . everybody who are ready to embrace with the guy , gary &apos;s offering .
are everybody ?
well , let me show you some more of it .
you know , it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , it &apos;s objective , the first time , the first time , when the second time , but i would make it a car to guess it was going to be real real .
because the images made it more real .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the world &apos;s problem , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between understanding ways , understanding the consequences with the individual possibilities , and that have to be the consequences and have to be felt .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more , if you use a <unk> or a credit card than in cash ?
because it &apos;s not what we really feels .
and it turns out that if you make it , it feels a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we have a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve made a study with people who were working on <unk> -- employees who were all in the <unk> in one in the <unk> they signed their participation in the <unk> .
and during this meeting , we &apos;ve just been this meeting as well as she was always , we &apos;ve added a little bit .
the little thing that we have to do is that we &apos;ve asked people to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives , if they would save money .
in that simple thing , we had this simple thing , there was a rise of involvement in the number of 20 percent , and there was a increase in the number of people who were willing to save or a increase in order to pay for the <unk> .
third technique : <unk> .
we can get better with more categories than more than more choices .
here &apos;s an example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> in the top , the number between <unk> various kinds of magazines to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
and if i &apos;m going to show you 600 magazines and i &apos;m going to show you into 10 categories or i &apos;m going to show you to 20 categories , and then they believe that i had given them more choice and a better <unk> than i had given them that 600 .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of <unk> .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the left is display is , and the display on the right is jazz , then clap in hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that &apos;s on the left is jazz and the , on the right side , then you clap them .
okay , a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a highly <unk> <unk> .
the categories must say something that &apos;s not the selection .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long list of all these conventions .
who are they really , they want to get ?
my fourth technique : the assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;m showing you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s make a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely too .
they have to make sure about 62 different decisions to design their car .
now these decisions are the number of choices that they make a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , gears -- four ways .
what i do now is i change the sequence of decisions .
half the clients goes from the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the very low possibilities , four gears .
the other half the clients goes from the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 <unk> , many ways .
what am i looking at ?
how are they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the <unk> of the decision , it &apos;s being overwhelmed , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find out is that people who are coming from the very low <unk> and and over again to vote .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the sequence is going to be the information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m like i &apos;m going to look at the simple .
even though the gears chooses , nothing about my preferences in the field , it would still take me to take it on it .
it also also made me too excited about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate me to be interested in interest .
let me recap .
i told you about four techniques that are the problem of the <unk> , narrow -- they &apos;re going to be the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; we can do it ; we can handle it ; we can handle it .
each of these techniques i &apos;m describing to you today is to help you manage to manage -- good for them , you can use them for themselves , good for people who they provide service .
because i think the key to best choices is that you &apos;re having the selection .
and the more we have to pick selective selective , we &apos;re better to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i &apos;m looking at a way to <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
now we want to talk today about how videos are going to be , and then , why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be a star -- <unk> , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so difficult .
but <unk> has made it that we all are all about our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet to the next saturday .
but at that , there are more like 48 hours of video a minute .
and again , it will only be a minuscule percentage ever , and it will look at thousands and so to the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
yay !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> this video that he had been filmed in the yosemite park .
in 2010 , it was been looking at 23 million times .
this chart shows how it was like , as the video of the first time was popular .
actually , no , wouldn &apos;t make viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , when you &apos;re <unk> <unk> , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually been broadcast in january .
what &apos;s going on ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet that the video has ended up so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , you can ask new and interesting things , and show a great audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . you didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation .
rebecca <unk> &quot; is one of the most famous video of the year .
it was looked at this year almost 200 million times .
this is what graphics looked like .
just like the &quot; double raindrop &quot; seems it made of nothing to be .
what happened to happen ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also <unk> .
but what about this day , this particular friday is that with this day ?
well , <unk> <unk> it , a lot of blogs started writing about this .
michael j. nelson from the science science of science science theater , one of the first one that made a joke .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of <unk> has been a point of view with a great audience and <unk> process .
then these community formed , people who shared these big <unk> , and i started talking to around and around it .
now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> .
already in the first seven days there was a parody for every single day of day .
unlike the 20th entertainment of the 20th century , the community of the community is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by making it or something new .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
it &apos;s just easy .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold it insane , you know , you know , there &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> that has been looked at four million times .
and even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
important is the creativity that &apos;s in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there was remixes .
somebody made an outdated version of it .
and then it &apos;s been international .
a total <unk> fired from the ground , which made it a silly joke to something that we can all participate .
now we don &apos;t just find delight to something , we &apos;re doing .
who would have all of the animal ?
who would have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; can predict ?
what can you do have been able to write the <unk> in which they were doing that ?
in a world , in the every minute of video , it &apos;s just uploaded to just unique and unexpected <unk> like the speaker just talked about .
i &apos;m going to admit , i was not a lot of interested in my friend , and i had to look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against the streets for the streets .
i got a traffic ticket because i &apos;m not on the <unk> , but often there &apos;s disabilities that have not the disability that we can drive a very easily ride on the <unk> .
and this was totally surprising and humorous , casey was a casey &apos;s funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and that &apos;s all leads us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access and in the audience .
like , one of the most of the moment , the most largest star -- justin -- -- i made his start with youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all of us , as the <unk> of our culture .
and these are not the features of the old media and they &apos;re not trying to be able to determine the entertainment entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i be talking about the interconnection between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this is in the life of a four-year-old girl , when you &apos;re in a <unk> of 30 years , her baby , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her grandmother , five days and nights , and her
the story is not yet by .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece , a man who &apos;s burning the <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom was held together .
hold him at the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes , as he &apos;s wishing to say that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> now .
he moved to silence .
he died , he had broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forget his life .
i had to worry about it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to be , we were to <unk> us , but we &apos;re going to be .
the next <unk> <unk> shows how a boat in the early <unk> <unk> <unk> .
my mother was 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> before , with two little girls .
and she had a job for her , the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat still on the lake as <unk> .
all of adults were aware of the risks .
the greatest fear had you before , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was a little <unk> .
and i was just going to have my sister , and i , then , and i &apos;d drink my grandmother and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- this is the successful <unk> of the motors , the clap of one every wave on the bug , the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , who were many times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the engine , six hours didn &apos;t want to launch .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> coast of the coast of the coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the flavor of the first <unk> , which was one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever been so cool .
after three months in the refugee camp , we landed in melbourne in melbourne .
and the next <unk> <unk> is about four women in three generations that build together a new life .
we settled down in <unk> down , one of the working <unk> acts of the <unk> <unk> of the population of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown to me , there was no <unk> .
the smells of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , between people , they had a thing in common : they started to new .
my mother worked on farms , then on one line of <unk> , six days , the layers of layers .
it would be able to find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and became more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do , and mostly the new stuff that came from the <unk> .
two couple of <unk> for school , each of to cover the holes in the other .
one <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to be six years .
and there were the rare <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and there and there &apos;s the <unk> : &quot; asians , goes home . &quot;
so , where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept at the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other of our grandmother , and heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from the boat .
and it was my job , every night , to stay awake until their <unk> came to me , so i could <unk> them .
she opened a <unk> , then then a <unk> and a <unk> .
and women came along with their stories about men who don &apos;t <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , and they were born between two worlds .
loans and sponsor sponsors .
centers were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one , i was the traditional asian student who was the <unk> demands on the <unk> .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence wore carrying , the <unk> and the isolation .
but so many got over the years of aid .
and because of this aid , i was <unk> in my last year as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was zoomed from a <unk> to the nearest , and the edges didn &apos;t fit .
tan le , anonymous <unk> von <unk> , was now <unk> le , refugee and social activist , who had never heard of the to places , and in the homes , whose lives , whose lives have never been .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to speak about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into routine , and the comfort of the life of a unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were so <unk> for the last 20 years , and <unk> each other stories of their day and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was going to climbed the boat .
no , no one was an opportunity .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said , &quot; and not , you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open to me , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all <unk> , so many of them did what they loved , the boundaries of the .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i could not be a career in law .
there was another one another thing to be another .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , but something you have to be grateful .
because <unk> can be so easily to collapse the horizons , so easily , you &apos;re the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world &apos;s <unk> , but not as you can it .
possibilities that hasn &apos;t been allowed to have been disruptive .
there was a energy , a optimism optimism , a strange <unk> of the humility and the <unk> .
so i follow my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the <unk> , &quot; the <unk> challenge is not .
a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
and then the end of one took my <unk> , i was cooking a huge strain of soup that we shared .
we worked until late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but there were a few brilliant , and we were doing the breakthrough .
i was trying to make the decision to go into the u.s.
just a trip there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and adventure on the adventure .
before i &apos;m going to <unk> the lecture , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the <unk> and the the local <unk> , the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her .
her mother moved on her own .
with 17 , she became the second woman a <unk> woman who was her .
without any support of their husband , she took him for a <unk> , by him and <unk> in her own , and a larger <unk> , and one more <unk> than she won .
&quot; no , &quot; may be <unk> .
i just <unk> in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and looked at the other side .
i knew she came to to say goodbye .
my mother would me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat in their own .
we told her stories and <unk> her , that we were still in their own .
and at midnight , the monk came from and said he had to close to the .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
she said the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s got it for granted today , &quot; he said .
&quot; you haven &apos;t leave you . &quot;
if it &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were and how we &apos;ve been formed , we can now see that the men who might be in our lives , we would be gone in the <unk> .
the defeat would be too easy .
now i &apos;d like to my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever want one wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , <unk> , <unk> .
can i tell you a bug in your life , the <unk> of all wave <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it , and you could be able to put it safely , i would do it .
and also , <unk> mother &apos;s the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because this is a picture of course , you can &apos;t take it to the camera .
but i began to photography , as i received my first digital digital digital , at age 15 years .
i combined it with my former <unk> , but it was a little different , because it was using the camera , in the process of planning .
and when you click a picture with a camera , the process , you end up with the trigger .
so for me , so , photography seemed to be more about to the right place to the right place .
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins to get it to be its way .
and then photos like this : a construction site is walking along a much <unk> road .
but it &apos;s got a kind of a twist .
and <unk> still a realistic level .
or photographs like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all of the purpose of the goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you really can get , but i want to look like this , as if you could have this , on a photograph .
and then , you know , you have to think a brief moment to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about to capture an idea when a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the color ?
is it going to be the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
and then , sometimes the illusion is the illusion .
but ultimately , the first thing is to look how to interpret the world , and how it can be made by a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put together an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect material here , we can all relate to a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can combine something that is something that &apos;s still in a little bit of what if it could be .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we can &apos;t think our brains , because our brain isn &apos;t really simply not really , it &apos;s not really meaning .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about sharing different realities .
so the things that make a look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think , because you &apos;re just looking wrong .
so i would say that there &apos;s three basic rules to achieve a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
and so , again , you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined the same way of the people should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photographs have the same <unk> .
and these two images are both of these two requirements -- and the same <unk> <unk> and the same <unk> .
and thirdly , it &apos;s about to be able to tell where the individual images begin and end by connecting them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photograph was actually put together .
so , by color , contrast , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic clusters of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we can look at the borders between the different images and and you see a single photograph , although a picture can look like a few of these beds .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s only a landscape , and the bottom is rigged .
so this image is actually completely composed of photos from different places .
i personally , i &apos;m a simple <unk> to create a place where you have to be a place , because you don &apos;t have to be a trade-offs to the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had the idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to plan to get to to the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
this bank comes from one another place .
the <unk> is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red , to look at cbgb .
to get a <unk> outcome , and it &apos;s going to be looking at planning to make .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a little good plan for each time .
and when you make good footage , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and it &apos;s quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools are available , and the only thing that &apos;s limited to us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic fail .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking about our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the <unk> , was to do a <unk> .
and they &apos;re not particularly scientifically scientifically -- it puts a cup of coffee or tea , and ask the patient , families , relatives , &quot; how do it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> fail : because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button , it &apos;s a button .
and every morning i get on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have to make my job with 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just simple : every time i jump to the scale , it &apos;s the google health data .
and there it also gets from my <unk> <unk> to see where my <unk> is , and not only in the moment i need for a <unk> , but i &apos;m looking at the past .
there &apos;s another thing .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with you , i &apos;ve got 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my <unk> and people talk to me , before i &apos;m in the car , &quot; lunch is a lunch just a little lettuce today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> of what can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that could be used for obesity , or it might patients the smoking .
it may also be used to get people from their chairs and to bring them to play some kind of game to control their health better .
every week , it comes to the market .
it will be that little <unk> that you &apos;re on an iphone or so <unk> .
and it will enable people to measure your blood pressure from home to your doctor , and for example , to share him for for instance , to share with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients are going to play , and they can &apos;t only be able to take control of their own ship , but can also help us in healthcare , in the face of the challenges that are , and the health care of health , generation , and so on .
do they make them , and they &apos;re going to get to a <unk> and start to hug in the team .
and they can achieve them through these kinds of ways , but also through crowdsource .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i &apos;d like to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the <unk> in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phone .
we know exactly where all the atm machines are around around the atm .
we know even one , where the stations are in the stations .
and clear , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving <unk> was at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did in <unk> in the netherlands .
we set up a website and a <unk> , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he &apos;s , &quot; because , &quot; because , he &apos;s closed , , of course , he &apos;s closed , of course , it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , already , in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we designed a <unk> .
we developed a app for <unk> , extended reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone goes down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can also find their <unk> to the next time , to find the next <unk> , which can save lives .
and then we don &apos;t want to just be a <unk> of what the product calls itself , but as a <unk> .
and we want to bring it to a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like <unk> to deal with these <unk> across the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and someone goes down and somebody goes down , it &apos;s your own blood , or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are helping us in the world of this <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or a technician for example , just to ensure that the <unk> is still still in its place .
please , please , they &apos;re trying to improve health , not only to improve the health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to cover from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> , wants us to force us to keep the environment .
... it gives you pay attention .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . one moment .
it may take until it &apos;s uploaded until it .
now , we can just skip the wrong -- i &apos;ll just skip the video ...
no .
it &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to take the star into technology and design , and to work a year , and in a environment , which is so much everything they hate , and we &apos;re going to work in the government .
so the program is &quot; code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> for the .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban staff .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible to show what &apos;s possible .
so , you meet al qaeda .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
this is what it looks like a date after a date , but what he really is looking for , is someone who &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s because he knows , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> when it &apos;s <unk> from a meter snow .
how did he come to look at this particular way for help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston to the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of <unk> <unk> .
and they noticed that the city never <unk> these fire fires .
but one particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , had another thing , and that was that the residents are free to the sidewalks , right in front of these parts .
so he did what any good designer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can sew a fire fire .
you <unk> to him free to him , when it <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al qaeda .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away from somebody .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic dynamic .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the slightest of the 21 apps that have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other <unk> .
it &apos;s spreading itself .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city of the city , who has seen that this app could use , not for snow , but to adopt the citizen .
it &apos;s very important that these are working , but people steal the batteries .
and so he got the citizen to check them .
and then , then decided to put seattle , to use the app to clean the citizens to clean the <unk> .
and chicago has just been introduced to people the <unk> <unk> when it <unk> .
so we &apos;re now now at nine cities , planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s all the time , organically , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know , it &apos;s not going to be like this .
the <unk> of software takes a few years in the rule .
we had a team that was working on a project last year for three people and two two months .
it was a technique that was looking at the parents that are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later , that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
there &apos;s a project now in the california law that cost the <unk> has cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s projects like this at all the level of the government .
so , a app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from <unk> , is a kind of shot in front of the the institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access to access that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation that the problem of the government -- not as the problem of an active institution , but as a problem of collective trade .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good in collective act with digital technique .
now there &apos;s a large community of people who are creating the tools we need to do things effectively .
it &apos;s not just the code for america , &quot; these are hundreds of people across the country that are up and write <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give them the government .
they &apos;re awfully frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix them .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the line of all the other things that we &apos;re really upset about is government , in the core , in the words , in the words , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those , please , i &apos;m going to change the things that you &apos;re changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is changing .
and because the government ultimately gets to take their power out of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we people people ? &quot; -- how we think about this , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about to choose people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s about the local time in the local , to <unk> .
this is the call center for service and information .
they tend to get out there when you &apos;re in your city <unk> .
if you ever have the chance of being in your <unk> center center , as a of the program , as part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;re going to see that the people are going to be -- you &apos;re going to see that people , the government for many different problems , including that , that a <unk> in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> .
he type &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . it &apos;s beginning to the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , you can just open all the doors in your house and see a loud music and see if the animal <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston is not just a call center .
it has a app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a work very smart people in the office of the new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a nickname -- this is a nickname -- i came into , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott <unk> <unk> human being human .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all the public <unk> , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we get , &quot; i went over there , the <unk> was behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . life ?
turned the <unk> on the side . went home .
good afternoon , cute <unk> . &quot;
pretty easy .
this is great . this is the digital self meets the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to make the .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i mean , i mean , i mean , not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped to another citizen , but the government was playing in a central role .
it connected these two people .
and you could have connect them to the government performance , if they were required , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state-owned services .
when a neighbor &apos;s neighbor , we &apos;re strengths to our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think is that government is not the same thing . politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
how often we chose political leaders -- and we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going back to us and we expect the government , our values and have it , and then it hasn &apos;t change much much ?
this is because the government is like a on the ocean , and politics is the supreme <unk> .
and what &apos;s below , is what we call burger bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this kind of contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and we &apos;re paying for , something that &apos;s against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to us , we have to make the bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we have to be involved in the government with the government .
so the <unk> <unk> did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more powerful citizen who wrote a very detailed <unk> report that &apos;s a response to the <unk> of the <unk> .
it &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , we have time to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to have to introduce you to have the enormous challenges you can imagine .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to achieve what we need to do without a institution that can do all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it &apos;s going to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government is fundamentally in a way that can actually reach something by turning society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up , and the know that it &apos;s not so difficult to do things together , you have to do just properly systems .
now the age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with her voice as a no-brainer .
they &apos;re fighting not this battle who all fighting the fight , so that &apos;s talk to speak , and they all are allowed to speak .
you can make their opinion , on every channel at every channel , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of the government , they don &apos;t care about their voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improved the work .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this may be a fire fire , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> flip .
and sure , we would have these these <unk> <unk> all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are paying for their taxes and performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government to improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all here for you here : if it &apos;s about the big important things we need to do , all together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands .
thank you .
and usually , my role in this is to explain people how wonderful the new technologies are being on the board , and i thought i &apos;m here with friends here , i &apos;d like to tell you what i really think about , and i i i think i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to try and understand what i really do . and i
i &apos;m going to start to show you a very one , boring slide .
so , you can just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve picked up from my folder folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather in the general form .
this slide shows a analysis of the performance of <unk> processors compared to the performance of a <unk> area .
so the interesting thing here is that this slide , like many other , which we find it in our field , a kind of just on a <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency in the <unk> .
and this is a novelty that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back on .
another bit more , because i &apos;m going to draw something to the paper .
now , why do we draw this graph in the technique in <unk> curves ?
the reason for this is , when i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , the time , and this is a measure of the technology that i want to be with a graph , it &apos;s going to be silly .
so , the look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , we say , a <unk> , then the <unk> scale , <unk> , in a flat line .
but if something like this is happening , this is what the <unk> changes .
so if the <unk> <unk> , as quickly as the <unk> would , we could get into a cab and in 30 seconds we &apos;d be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
this has never been before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , by which the order of the order of the order for the .
so the question i want to you to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , they &apos;re not going to go forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is forever and just as fast as now .
there are two ways .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> of like this , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen to this .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m a optimist , so i think this is something like this .
it &apos;s really like this , then this means that we &apos;re in the right now in a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world in a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often want to ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what &apos;s this new state to think slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about , what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people are talking about the future , and you realize the future is still in 2000 .
so , we don &apos;t go to that .
so in other words , the future is going to be nearly since i am in this world .
i think the reason is that we &apos;re going to be there there &apos;s something .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s simply not going to make a sense of trying to be 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything else is going to be so different , a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now is simply not making sense .
so i want to talk about what this is , this transition in which we &apos;re at right now .
so to make this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really nothing with technology or computers .
because i think this really , to understand this , we have to go back a step back and look at the one more <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life on earth .
i think the full picture makes sense when you split it into some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s a a billion years , and the earth was a large , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals , then we have a pretty good picture of how they did the <unk> .
i think there are theories that start to understand how everything with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little story of this , which is that time little <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> of chemicals in the chemicals .
some of these <unk> in their <unk> , a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from the outside of the outside , and they grow .
everybody was so , started to be .
these little <unk> were in the sense of the <unk> .
but these are not the <unk> of the living in the same sense , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe by chemicals .
and every time it divided , it &apos;s <unk> chemicals to the existing amount of chemicals .
so every one &apos;s a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which is a <unk> of that , and then <unk> and integrated and more chemicals from the outside and we shared faster .
so these tended to survive , and they have to be an equal extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this <unk> <unk> looks a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t understand yet understand this <unk> , the ability to <unk> information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information and that in a particular chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this <unk> , evolutionary way , the way that they were made of <unk> , so that this information stored and copied .
the amazing thing is that this kind of information is to store the way that this is about two billion years ago , it was the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is what our genes are the exact same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s the same thing that every creature is used the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re far as we &apos;re , just to the <unk> , to write in this code .
and i have 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m going to keep in airports from <unk> .
it &apos;s -- what i did is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made by normal letters that we use to <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and it &apos;s 10 ^ 22 times more powerful .
so if someone wants to take a hundred million copies of their <unk> , i &apos;d like enough for everybody in this room , and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been a <unk> , i &apos;d put it on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s next step ?
the <unk> of the dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made it for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting , very interesting , very interesting , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s started to communicate these cells and share information , so communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew it , but bacteria actually can exchange their dna .
and this is why the reason for example is growing for an asset .
some bacteria have figured out how to have <unk> <unk> , and you &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are <unk> in penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
and this communication also allowed to set of communities , which was in a sense of the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they either survive , or they were going to be under . that meant that if a community had been successful , all the individuals of the community are repeatedly repeatedly and by evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close to the recipe for the whole community to write the dna on the dna .
and the next interesting thing took about another billion years .
at this point , we have communities communities , communities of lots of <unk> <unk> , which are together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a kind of <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells that are not being asked .
your skin cells are inanimate without heart cells , muscle cells , and so on .
so these communities began to <unk> the level that the level of the evolution was no longer the single cell , but the whole <unk> that we call organism .
the next step was now within these communities .
the <unk> started to <unk> information .
and they developed special structures that are nothing different than information within organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures , which are responsible for learning and to get this information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning happened to the time of life &apos;s lifespan , rather than this evolutionary amount of time .
so , an organism could be learning a certain of fruit not eat because she liked it and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
this could be taken within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas from hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned by the individuals that were orphaned because these <unk> were still not available .
so the nervous system has the <unk> process of this special <unk> because evolution could be within a individual .
it could take place within a time .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms were going to communicate with each other .
so , as example , the <unk> of this <unk> is the human language .
it &apos;s a rather intriguing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically taking some <unk> notes from me in the hope that a similar idea of a similar idea of a similar idea of a similar idea of how to create your own life , which is a resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns out to sound , a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to be as a unified organism to work again as a unified organism .
and what we &apos;re doing is we , we , humanity , we &apos;ve just started to abstract .
we &apos;ve gone through the same stages , which are through the way -- the abstraction of our methods , as we tie data , we &apos;re presenting data .
the invention of the language is , for example , is a smaller step into this direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> , and so on all of these specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also can continue to evolve than we were so far .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little <unk> , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> <unk> again .
the first step of the story i &apos;ve told you , a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , very few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and it becomes so , i think , <unk> is the word for this -- when something its <unk> <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster change it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that feeds itself on itself .
i live living in the building , and i know i &apos;m using the mechanism i &apos;m using using computers , not using computers without the recent advances .
my current activity is to design objects with such a very high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking is <unk> , we think , in a certain <unk> , the machine makes this , and the machine makes something that our skills far beyond , better and faster than we could do it .
and it &apos;s partly with ways that we don &apos;t even understand properly .
a way , what &apos;s interesting interesting is , which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve used in time has been a lot of time , is evolution .
and we put a <unk> in the machine that &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
to call an example , in the extreme cases , we can make a program that &apos;s made of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , a hundred million randomly chosen the <unk> sequences of the audience .
now , please , please , i &apos;m all of these randomly chosen claims , all of the programs , and pick up those who are the next ones . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to say numbers , this would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for this .
so , what are programs that are most likely to be able to put numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly chosen is very small , that it &apos;s just a chance to be a number of chance , so probably the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
but one of those may be two of these things like something that are two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that my <unk> are coming to the next .
and you get this off , <unk> the rest .
now , <unk> all the <unk> that have the numbers in the .
it &apos;s a technique of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are the features of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through , which was something closer to the , and they were others .
tell , &quot; please this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
you may have some mutations .
and try it again with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years from the computer in less minutes , or in more complex cases , a few hours .
and finally , i get programs that can sort of perfect .
in fact , these programs are so efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever write by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell me how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s kindred and strange programs .
but they get the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure that you get the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their lives depended on whether they were doing it right .
so i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky &apos;s <unk> , he <unk> a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at you .
there &apos;s this plane , this plane is made of <unk> <unk> , which work together to make their flight secure , &quot; don &apos;t you don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> is not optimal when it becomes complicated .
so we start to leave computer , for a process which is very different from classical advances .
he allows us to do with a much higher complexity than it would allow us to produce the normal ways .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the potential of it yet .
so <unk> <unk> technology is us .
we use these programs to make the computer a lot faster , so we can do these processes even faster .
so it &apos;s a <unk> .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems like <unk> .
because all these new technologies of these are fed today .
we raise up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analogous to the time when <unk> evolved to <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite a really good thing to hell we &apos;re actually trying to do here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really think that &apos;s going to be something .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to say that we &apos;re the the end of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of the creation of what &apos;s always going to be next .
now , the lunch is , before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to be more .
my story begins right here in a rajasthan , two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert , with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that hasn &apos;t been changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel to the time , we went into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian <unk> thirst was <unk> thirst , he took a bow , fired in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic is replaced with machines .
so , i really sad .
i got a little bit of a technology .
it was frightened of me that i could have to lose the ability to <unk> the <unk> without tweet , my friends .
i found that technology magic should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology was the <unk> thing for me .
it was a <unk> access to a world of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my idea .
i came up with this , when we had us to break out and to have some cameras from it to dream .
they were being inspired by being inspired by being inspired .
and so in the world , i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to be magic , instead of killing .
i started to illustrate books with books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling the readers of the world can connect .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bring images and text and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling thing is always more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive prosthetic app .
here &apos;s like , &quot; put your fingers on each light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s like this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i work -- that &apos;s really to me <unk> .
the child in me is really excited about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean to magicians and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found it .
so you have to hold the ipad and fireflies are fireflies .
and the <unk> of the way through the rest of the book .
one other idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single galaxy .
and so , there &apos;s a book , and every world is a little <unk> that i &apos;m taking here to the magic device in the device .
and this is opening up a map .
<unk> always had maps and these maps were static .
this map grows and and it &apos;s an orientation in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing you other people &apos;s favorite .
i &apos;m going on here .
it &apos;s important to me , to make something that is a lot of <unk> , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught in <unk> homes in an old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary story for children .
a story that has the same thing to the other level of the world &apos;s <unk> .
to the point of <unk> , a huge problem for the last 10 years is that children in their dorm room , you know , without <unk> .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you get to search for a search , you have to go out and to collect the <unk> of the ipads pictures of natural objects .
as a child , i had rocks and rocks and stones and <unk> .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do it .
this is <unk> <unk> . you have to go out to a chapter one of a flower and tag a picture .
in another chapter , you have to <unk> a piece of <unk> and tag .
and so you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online online .
a child in london shows the image of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey monkeys . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually have .
there &apos;s a variety of potential to the world and technology to connect with .
in the next book , we &apos;re designing a interaction where you use the video of the ipads and through <unk> reality animation , animation &apos;s augmented animation that &apos;s on a plant in a plant .
and in a place , the screen is catching leaves .
you have to make the sound of the <unk> , and you blow the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the beneficiaries of technology gets closer and and in the magic and technology can be evolving .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , prisons , prisons .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest of the <unk> and in places where there are very much despair .
and here at ted , to see , to see , how cymatics is , has been very much power .
in the short time here , i got a clear : ted has an identity .
you can tell here things that have the world .
and sometimes , when something about ted comes , it gets meaning and strength that it doesn &apos;t have .
i say that , because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good , as a doctor doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional <unk> household who was dominated by a <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , it had been .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia than slaves .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also <unk> .
if i met her as a young boy , she came to me and i was <unk> .
and she hit me so i could barely breathe , and then i let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; <unk> , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , &quot; i &apos;ll put it back . &quot; i said , &quot; let me go to quiet .
she was something that was that you wanted to be in her close .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have to be eight or nine , i woke up one waking in the morning , and all my cousins are around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and i was looking at me .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very seriously .
this was 15 minutes , and then i was going to come over and i came over and she got me over and said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me out to go out and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise you don &apos;t have to promise you . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down , and i looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to be watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise to me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first first <unk> me that you &apos;re going to love your mum &apos;s always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mum &apos;s mom , and you have to promise you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
so i dialed my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next thing i &apos;m telling me is that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yeah , i , i promise . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is , &quot; you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , i , i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s got older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this fateful beer with grabbed my sister and me and went into the forest .
we just just like it as well as it .
then he took a <unk> of beer and offering my sister , and she took me , and then i offered them one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s all right . i don &apos;t want to beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do that , you know , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had the , your sister &apos;s what &apos;s going to be , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . do it just . it &apos;s just doing it . &quot;
my brother , i started to my brother .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , but what &apos;s going to you ? &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not still crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody &apos;s paying for the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed .
i &apos;m going to confess to you .
i should probably do that .
this is a way to translate this .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , i <unk> that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity is power .
if we can do the right kind of identity , we can tell us to tell us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their grandkids , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prison prison in prison .
my uncle died in the <unk> diseases .
and they believed that these are the issues that we need to care .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people in <unk> and prison .
today , there are 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest world &apos;s tallest world .
seven million people are on <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
my view , in my mind , we have radically changed our world .
in social and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore to the washington -- is 50 to 60 percent of all the blacks men either in prison in prison in prison , in prison , or with <unk> <unk> .
but our system will not only be formed by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also driven by poverty .
we have a <unk> that you &apos;re going to be treated in this country , if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
assets , not <unk> , the outcome .
but yet we seem to be satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger , we believe that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost the contact .
i think interesting .
there &apos;s some of the most fundamental things .
my home in <unk> , you will permanent the <unk> when you &apos;re convicted of <unk> .
here , in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population is lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years is the percentage of the <unk> of the urban <unk> is so high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m kids kids .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the child &apos;s <unk> children in jail .
in this country , it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we already have a lot of ways .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death is an interesting question .
we believe because we taught us that the true question is : has a person to die for him to die of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : has a crimes of death , but : did we deserve it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america defined by error .
so on nine people we executed , one of us to be innocent , the <unk> and made of the death row .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never leave someone with a plane , if at nine planes , who gets off one .
but somehow we can do it , we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m presenting a ted story . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time to the beginning of the world , until the beginning of the second world .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people have to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talks . they say they &apos;re talking about , and they say , &quot; they say , &quot; they say , &quot; they say , to stop saying , for the first time in history of our nation with terrorism : after september 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- say , &quot; you &apos;re going to be growing up with the people that we grew up with it .
and after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of motivated submission and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning we did in the historical context .
we &apos;re going to get together .
we can always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> doesn &apos;t have to be the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , it was these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been talking about the talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply bizarre to hear you so talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty death penalty .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it was very silent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible to tell us to the systematic people .
it would be <unk> from us , and people people are <unk> . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like , in a world where the german state of people were <unk> , especially if there were many jewish people .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the u.s. of the old <unk> , we &apos;re going to go -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of deaths , 11 times higher , when the victim is black .
and yet there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we &apos;re not concerned with these tough issues , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities are suffering , abuse , <unk> , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite .
because we &apos;re talking about that we need more hope , more involvement , more dedication to be in a complex world .
for me , to think , to think , to think about the poor , the disadvantaged , who are never going to be at ted .
but think in a way that is in our own life , integrated in our own life .
we all have to think of the first things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re as we &apos;re as we &apos;re doing , we value .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> that i think it &apos;s driving us , not just open to all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought for oppression , we wanted to be the <unk> , we wanted to be a sense of hope , a mental orientation , an mental orientation , the willingness to be , and , at <unk> places , and being witness . &quot;
and this is the core orientation is the core of what i think that the people have to engage in this .
there &apos;s no one of us to be a technology and design that allows us to be very , and human beings , as we don &apos;t even have eyes and ears , <unk> and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more than if we were not about it .
it will touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i was the great privilege of pink parks .
and then , ms. parks came back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends , these older women , <unk> <unk> , who had had a tremendous <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white -- and virginia <unk> , a white -- and virginia <unk> , a white , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women were met and they were just a conversation .
and then , then , woman <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , ms. park coming in the city . we want to talk .
do you want to be <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very , very like .
she said , &quot; and what will you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m listening to listening . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard just too .
it was always been so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i sat there and i heard these women , and after a few hours , and then , and i was told us , &quot; well , &quot; <unk> , tell me what the &quot; initiative are right now .
what do they try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put injustice against injustice .
<unk> , people want to help people were innocent .
we want to fight the <unk> and discrimination to the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> without a genetic child for children .
we want something to the death penalty company .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , he rejected , raping <unk> to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we have to find ways to ask these challenges , these problems , this is suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a couple of simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we ever did .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
if someone lie is , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a thief .
even who kills someone , not just a killer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that the law needs to respect the law .
i think that in many parts of this country , and with safety parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s not .
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so exhilarating , we don &apos;t have been measured at the end of our technology , not in the things we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and mind .
and finally , a society is not measured how they &apos;re going to be the rich and powerful and privileged to synchronize , but how they treat the poor , the convicted of , the <unk> .
because in this context , we start to understand the really amazing things that we &apos;re .
i i assured that balance . one story to end .
sometimes i implore to push .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas , we predict , in a very important way .
i was <unk> these kids who were convicted too hard punishment .
i go into the <unk> and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and should be an adult .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn into something that he &apos;s not ?
judge looks at the judge as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long , and i thought my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also want to .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really , i started to work on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor , poor young young boy .
and i started with this bill . the headline was : &quot; to my arms , <unk> black client like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> .
in my bill , i explained to be that misconduct of the <unk> and the police as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as
there was a insane line of this country that there &apos;s nothing more <unk> in this country that it &apos;s only more <unk> .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know whether i was just dreamed of these crazy , or i was writing .
and i didn &apos;t know my horror , i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent to the court .
a few months went over and i had just forget everything .
but then finally , i decided my god , i have to be able to be able to do this crazy case .
i stepped into the car , and it was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
and finally , i went from my car , and i went to the the to the court .
when i was the stairs for the meal , there was an elderly , black man , the job was the job in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and i was <unk> .
then he whispered to me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , it was me .
and it touched a little bit deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single person to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , have you put this crazy set for ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and office workers .
in the <unk> , the <unk> was full of people who were angry , we talked about skin color , above poverty , above inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors and down .
and he kept looking through the window and i could hear the whole thing .
he went on and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and sat down right behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judges announced to have a break .
and he came in a <unk> , and he was was , the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the <unk> , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give it .
i came to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far far , but it &apos;s the justice .
we &apos;re not being completely designed as humans , unless we take care of human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is connected to survival .
we have visions of technology and creation , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and especially , i want to tell you that , as well as you see , don &apos;t get the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give them .
you have this audience , this community , the very obvious wish , and i heard of them to help and do something .
what can we do still ?
<unk> <unk> : well there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s about , actually a effort , to do something by the <unk> <unk> , which is the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for the death penalty billion dollars for the death penalty .
and yet , <unk> percent of all the <unk> is not with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all <unk> come from trial .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this is a <unk> message will suggest that money in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are ways everywhere .
for the last three decades , the u.s. has been huge down in america .
this is a lot of times in a relationship with elevated <unk> .
what would you tell someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of the <unk> is not very much .
most of the most of the most <unk> in this country didn &apos;t really didn &apos;t really have the class of the <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> for drugs .
so , the dramatic , the dramatic figures come down to prisoners .
we have <unk> from the rhetoric of the rhetoric .
now we have <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> people for whatever you can get behind the bars for a <unk> , rather than that you force them to give them to the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more , to help people who have become a <unk> , not less .
and i think our current <unk> is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , they really have a string string .
they &apos;re inspiring personality .
thank you for ted , thank you very much .
it &apos;s death , it &apos;s an increased <unk> .
two : famine in somalia . the police <unk> spray .
four : <unk> <unk> . sweeney : dangerous <unk> .
six : social <unk> . 65 <unk> is a <unk> .
8 : <unk> . speakers .
different speaker : <unk> . weapons .
recession . it . it . <unk> . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria . syria
crisis . disaster . disaster .
oh my god .
so , these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it &apos;s also the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media would prefer to show us negative topics , because our mind is going to be attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second day , our senses are more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we don &apos;t have anything more important than our survival , the first stop the information is a part of our <unk> , the the the the the the the the controls .
so the the the the the the the the the the the <unk> is our <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> all the information on the <unk> of the risk of the risk of the environment in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at bad news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it <unk> , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , seven seven hours a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not miraculous that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
it &apos;s probably the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible for the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already .
and as humans , we &apos;re a lot better at the very long term , but they eventually have to get to the end of it .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so we can have to have the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled that &apos;s <unk> , the world &apos;s population is <unk> .
child mortality has a tenth of lower .
and it comes out that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communications costs themselves to have a permanent .
so steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re living in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is gone from 25 percent of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we raise our expectations are all the time .
we actually defined poverty .
you think that a great percentage of americans who live below the poverty poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , televisions , mobile , <unk> , <unk> and cars .
the richest in the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have been able to dream like this .
the basis of a lot of these are producing technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the <unk> of all 12 to 24 months .
it &apos;s about mobile phone in your bag about a million times less and thousands of times faster than a reward from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how <unk> it &apos;s going -- in good like in bad times , war or peace , of depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers , the faster computers .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic <unk> <unk> on the left is to be up .
so the rate of the rate of growth itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a number of extraordinary technologies that are all available .
<unk> , something that my friends at the <unk> of the <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow to to redesign the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> biology , <unk> , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have the victory of <unk> socialist from the risk of socialist lawrence ?
that was a big big .
i &apos;ve had the newspapers and after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemies . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about the the <unk> of the language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence would have a <unk> of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i here at ted , a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies at the way , as we &apos;re going to be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we &apos;re asking the students , companies , products and services that within a decade of life can affect lives in a decade .
think about that a group of students can impact the lives of billions of people today .
thirty years ago , this was ridiculous .
we can have the one that we &apos;ve done in dozens of companies .
and if i think of , i think , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about a living of opportunities .
it &apos;s about making a few of goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resources of the power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he &apos;s invited the king of kinshasa to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> , however , <unk> .
aluminum was at this time , the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> made made of aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> is not as a metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology has developed and made it so inexpensive that we use it with our <unk> .
then let &apos;s take this analogy for the future .
we think about <unk> today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with more energy than we use a year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar is dropped in 50 percent year .
last month , this one of the month ago , that shows that until the end of this decade in the u.s. areas , solar energy per mile in the u.s. area compared to 15 cents a year at the national average costs .
and if we have a <unk> , we then then have water in abundance .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , the <unk> in 1990 when it was saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how it was it ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet that has been covered in water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent saline , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting to lie to the gulf of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today , dean ornish , one of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the <unk> of you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , which means &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard the size of a <unk> in
it can generate a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether seawater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a gallon .
the head of coca-cola has just been <unk> , a large <unk> with a hundred units in the developing world .
and if everything is fine , and i &apos;m very confident , this technology will apply to be more about this technology globally in <unk> countries on the planet .
this is disruptive innovation that &apos;s now .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get to the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2010 .
just think that a <unk> cell phone in the middle of kenya is a better <unk> of the <unk> than president / 11 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communications in abundance , how no one ever could have predicted .
and it gets better , things that you &apos;re spending a thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology at medical diagnostics -- are literally <unk> and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and
and the best thing about it is perhaps what &apos;s going to be in the domain of health .
last month , i had the pleasure of the <unk> that so-called $ 10 million <unk> x prize .
we need team team around the world , all these technologies in a mobile phone , and they can talk to the machine , because it can be linked to network , you can <unk> <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to diagnose a better diagnosis than a team of the physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a country country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the people &apos;s health .
if this device was a <unk> or <unk> , which is not known , &quot; it &apos;s <unk> and it &apos;s been to have a pandemic in their outbreak .
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to have to have a world of abundance .
i call it the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on the population .
we just have the <unk> .
and by the way , the largest <unk> is against a better upbringing and diet throughout the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;re going to get <unk> from two to five billion .
three billion new heads of which we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are they going to want ?
and instead of a culture , i see one of the largest economic history of history .
these people represent several <unk> dollars that will be available into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to get a healthier , and they &apos;re going to be more educated by the <unk> , and by doing that , you have the opportunity to have 3d and &quot; <unk> computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can we can bring three billion billion , educated , productive members of the <unk> of us ?
how would it be a set of new , never before <unk> .
how would it be the oppressed , wherever they are , to be a voice to make it and change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people get into ?
how about <unk> , how to <unk> , we don &apos;t even know ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passionate and focus , extraordinary things , things that are large companies and governments only in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that might already know some of you .
it &apos;s a game called solved .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
and the way we can do is we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputers .
and this game was played by university university .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of thousands of people are played online .
and it showed that today , today , today , the human pattern pattern is better the protein that &apos;s going to the best .
and when these people came and looked at who the best <unk> of the world was this , it wasn &apos;t a <unk> , either , it was a <unk> , manchester , a woman who worked in a <unk> and <unk> and night , and the best <unk> of the world was working on a <unk> and night at night .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me tremendous confidence in our future , is the fact that we have more power to do the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to technology with exponential technology .
we have a passion of the <unk> .
we have the capital of the <unk> .
and we have three billion new minds we can work online to follow the new challenges , and to do what necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to do a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s with a medical medical , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough of the business in the time that i can give me a piece of my own my own <unk> .
but before i talk to my talk about my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the <unk> near and move to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
so , baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; appears soon and turn statistics and to make this a great <unk> of baseball .
i &apos;m going to share a statistic that i hope most of you &apos;ve heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 when a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is probably beating by 10 beats .
this is called the ball into the <unk> , he comes down , he &apos;s not caught the first base base , it didn &apos;t have been done on time and the deck of security .
three of 10 .
you know how to call a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
good , really well , maybe a <unk> .
you know how to call a <unk> card ?
this is somebody who &apos;s probably four four from 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball player during a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less less than i talked about it .
imagine you have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to a <unk> , which is <unk> 400 to a <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine they live in a particular neighborhood , and they have a loved people with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> , which is <unk> at 200 times .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s a <unk> branch .
and it &apos;s punching a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think of the <unk> of a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , should be a <unk> ?
thousand , very good .
the truth is that no one in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor or a doctor or <unk> .
but what we do is we &apos;re all of them , including me , in the world , to be a good perfect .
never do a mistake , no one thing makes you think about the details of how to be done .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
high school , a school school said that brian would learn to a <unk> .
and so it was also .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the nurses at the <unk> of general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my favorite , i learned the origins and the tail every branch of one artery , which is the aorta of the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i actually knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the whole time i collected and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the medical school with the sense i memorized everything , and i knew everything that , or at least as much as possible as possible as possible , i was able to make immunity to make mistakes .
and it worked for a long time until i met a printer printer .
i was <unk> in a <unk> here in toronto , and i was brought to my <unk> a little printer to my <unk> hospital .
at this point i was born at this stage of the <unk> roll .
and it was my assignment to study the <unk> <unk> council , to study the <unk> .
and to give feedback to my <unk> .
i looked printers printers and she was in <unk> .
and when i tune her to her , they made sound sounds .
and when i was her chest , and when i was her chest , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which was told me that she suffered under <unk> heart failure .
this is a state in the heart , instead of blowing the blood on the blood , it puts a part of the blood inside of the lung , and filling them together , so the <unk> came .
and that was not a difficult diagnosis .
i hired them and i was treating the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i was given to take the pressure of the heart of hearts .
i had the medicine that we call <unk> water , so that they &apos;re the fluid .
and over a five- to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt good good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on the turn on , and i did what a call was on my <unk> , it would have a chance to do it with him , so he had a chance to do a own picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to have given extra information to her <unk> .
i may do it with good reason .
maybe i wouldn &apos;t be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
i may be successful and so successful and as capable of what i was was , and so i could have to have to have to contact my patients with my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i <unk> a little voice in my own , trying to say , &quot; the <unk> , don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , it was so very much of the <unk> i asked the nurse , and what was to take a , and he was okay , &quot; believe it &apos;s okay when you &apos;re going home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will be good . &quot;
i remember this as it was yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and an ambulance and <unk> and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> sensation in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and he went to the hospital , and i went home to go home to the car home , when i did something else i didn &apos;t do .
i went home with the <unk> <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , she said , not the sister that after woman , but another three words to me and these three words are afraid of most <unk> i know .
other doctors fear these same as well , but the <unk> is very special because we see the patient only fleeting .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient , who they were going to go home ? &quot;
ask the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
so about an hour after she came home , after i &apos;d been sending it back home , she collapsed and the family called 911 , and the <unk> , they brought back on the <unk> with a blood pressure with a blood pressure .
they barely barely breathing and blue <unk> .
the <unk> moved to all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they closed them to the <unk> .
i was shocked and down to the inner <unk> .
and i through this rollercoaster because she came to the <unk> in <unk> , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , realized that she would never even shattered again .
she didn &apos;t even suffered a <unk> <unk> .
their family got together .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they turned out to the <unk> .
the day day they &apos;re going to get them -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say , you &apos;re never forget the names of the <unk> .
and this was the first time i learned that .
the next weeks i made for , and i learned the first time of the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt isolated , not the kind of functional shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you know all the healthy shame , if you &apos;re a secret of the best friend &apos;s the , even though this one is <unk> , and you get caught and the best friend gets one to be confronted and and the best friend gets one to be confronted and and i think the best friend gets to be confronted and and you <unk> that one of that .
if you do <unk> , and the mistakes never makes the mistakes .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
the <unk> kind of the <unk> i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you heart .
it &apos;s the one that says that doesn &apos;t mean what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason of my <unk> , it was very gentle .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he had the <unk> <unk> , and sure i would not sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why am i going to get her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going to medicine ?
slowly slowly , it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day , day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke , and i i could tell me , i could feel better .
and i was struck with me that if i had my effort to perfection and never again a mistake that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did it .
and i was working on .
and then again , again , again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 year-old old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of it , and i &apos;m going to be in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet when he went out of the door , he showed his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next birthday , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember to the patient with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he &apos;s a <unk> .
he had an potentially <unk> disease called <unk> disease .
you can see that , but it &apos;s not a infection of the car , but the top of the <unk> , and causes the <unk> .
and fortunately he died .
he got <unk> <unk> , and recovered were a few days later .
and i went back through the same ritual of shame and self-doubt , and i felt <unk> and went back to work until again and again and again again .
in a <unk> , i &apos;ve been missing two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of time you heard about , especially if you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no players in their treatment .
i thought he was a <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the kidneys , when it was without <unk> , my colleague at the patient &apos;s favorite , my colleague , the patient &apos;s <unk> on the lower right , and called the <unk> .
the other had a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to him to him , and asked my colleagues also to judge him .
and he did , and he was doing a <unk> in the right at the right , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> and it was all of them .
and they were both <unk> <unk> to me , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , what many of my colleagues would say , but is total nonsense .
some of my <unk> happened happened in the last five years .
it alone , for me , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t want to leave my mind and talk about you , if i &apos;m the silent voice that i can &apos;t find , how can i share with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what i think about myself .
when did you talked the last time of someone who was talking about <unk> about <unk> about <unk> ?
oh , you &apos;re going to a cocktail party and you may hear about any doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was full of colleagues in a room with colleagues and to ask their support support , and i started to tell you what i &apos;ve just told you , i wouldn &apos;t be able to reach the end of the second story before it really , , before it really , a joke , &quot; you would change the subject and you would change the rest .
and in fact , if i would know , or my colleagues , that a <unk> <unk> would be lost the wrong leg , then i believe you , i have trouble with him in the eyes .
this is the system where we live .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who are doing , and those who don &apos;t do . those who <unk> <unk> and the without the <unk> that <unk> <unk> and the ones that with bad results and the with the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction to the , like antibodies that people attack .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones that make mistakes from medicine , that we have a system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medicine and journalism , i have a medical medical study about medical failures and wrong treatments for my first article i was to my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , &quot; wrote , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes is absolutely <unk> .
we work in a system where we &apos;re working in a system where a <unk> of the <unk> is either a fake or <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> and and always , and and it &apos;s always causing the devastation and dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die at <unk> mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has been at 100,000 .
they &apos;re both strong <unk> because we &apos;re not looking at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in the medical knowledge , the medical knowledge is doubled , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own a cognitive mistakes , so we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with a patient .
then i take the same patient with <unk> , and he <unk> it and <unk> and give it a slightly <unk> breath and suddenly the story of contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trend .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of that summed errors is inevitable .
so if you take the system as it takes it , and all the <unk> <unk> gets out , then there &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white <unk> , black . &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would like to be the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
and then your pupils dilate , they &apos;re hit the head , then watch down and swallow , and start to tell her stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment which you put it in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new doctor &apos;s doctor is a human , to be aware of his humanity , is not proud to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all made of them to learn to learn so that it can be passed on .
they divides their experience with others .
it supports them when others talk about their mistakes .
and they &apos;re showing others their mistakes , not to <unk> , but in a loving , supportive , supporting the way of it .
and it &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s like , people make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is to make sense that make easier make mistakes that are going to be , and also enable to create supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive supportive , which anyone who are going to be , and that &apos;s what happens to people like me , which is the potential mistakes and it will be rewarded .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new doctor &apos;s doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn to get it to be able to pass it .
i don &apos;t know what to hold me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , you know , he was <unk> .
you think they &apos;re going to hunt , but it &apos;s not true .
and actually , it was a <unk> fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
until the 80s in the 80s , he was in great style .
now , in the red list , are now .
this story has heard many times from the the the the the the the the the the the other places , it &apos;s not very special .
however , we &apos;re still going to the the same thing .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the <unk> is still described as pristine .
what &apos;s going on ?
the second story is to take a different concept , the <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s a point .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 to a lagoon in the <unk> .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate this .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really know from there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the lagoon of <unk> and some mangroves <unk> <unk> .
there were <unk> <unk> from about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were good and made it all the way into ghana above .
when i returned to this , and i returned to the , the fish was shrunk to half its size .
thirty centimeter is going to be five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish was lucky to be there .
so it &apos;s nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story is told by my favorite story at the <unk> of southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- i was more at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> meant countries that were already 100 fish , the industrial fishing that was pretty ugly ship , called the fourth of a <unk> ship .
i went on it and we were going to see all the southern northern ocean <unk> and particularly in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know it was the reason of the ocean .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected with the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the wreckage , the <unk> , were <unk> .
and essentially the reason came down , and then it &apos;s got <unk> .
these images are extraordinary because the transition goes very fast .
within a year you get a survey by and then with the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to change . -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals are going to do .
this is a dead turtle turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
and once again , we started alive .
she wasn &apos;t even <unk> .
they then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them .
in fact , this mountain will cut up that mountain of each of the fishermen are flowing when they drive into areas that never had a fish in the other .
it &apos;s not even documenting .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our <unk> of the new level , and they don &apos;t feel like what was there .
if you zoom in it , it &apos;s going to happen .
and on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
it &apos;s time to be changing . it &apos;s changing , because for people are all of of course their actions .
every generation look at the beginning of their own mind , and the standard and will get everything that .
it &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can be able to give you some of changes .
and at the end , they want to get the most <unk> remains .
that &apos;s now , is our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not as they were .
you may now think that the problem was in , as they lived in <unk> societies , and they only had to be aware of a few generations , what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very often , once before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose the world of the world .
you &apos;re still loses by rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
we &apos;re going to focus on the big animals , and in the sea , the big fish are the fish .
they &apos;re less risky because we &apos;re catching them .
and we &apos;re going to have a lot of fish , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people are , scientists , confirm it was really different .
they will confirm it because the evidence of how they are in a previous form , they &apos;re not as the evidence to describe the evidence .
so , for example , the anecdote that the report of a <unk> exhibition that in this area of big <unk> , which is not used to be used , or <unk> , or not normally <unk> , because it &apos;s not <unk> .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is a huge amount of role that can play a marine protected .
because in marine reserves , we basically put the past .
we can make the past the past , which people can &apos;t understand because the <unk> has changed and very low .
so , people who are seeing a marine protected , and the look at the insight that allows it to reset their <unk> .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle of the world ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remember the avatar .
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; think , if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except by the <unk> , why were they so touching this ?
because it &apos;s something that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to be cameron , which is cameron , so he &apos;s about cameron , it &apos;s the avatar .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to register a typewriter , that &apos;s the government .
they also had to register a leaf with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could break , where a text came from .
and they found an article with <unk> <unk> , and they could track the creator of the thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , and how much that i would do the free of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , you get a new <unk> of the leading <unk> and print a page , this side bright yellow <unk> on every page , in a pattern that lets the page <unk> into them and its printer .
this is what happens today .
and it seems to be a lot of <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments , the technology against us , the citizens of us .
and this is one of the three <unk> of the ones today that are today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks into categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easily to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge ton of money .
there are several cases cases of <unk> , <unk> that they have a lot of money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people are available online to the richness , but they have illegal to the <unk> , to the money from our <unk> , and we do our <unk> , or <unk> , which is the <unk> of the keyboard that we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard , while we shop on a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss ledger quote from mr. sam <unk> here , and in this <unk> , <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. <unk> himself is on free foot , which is <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;m happy to say that it &apos;s more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it will only be worse .
in the future , most of the crime online .
the second largest <unk> that we &apos;re seeing today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , i think , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they have become a <unk> of the <unk> in the field of the <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : <unk> , who are doing it for money , as anonymous , as anonymous , the <unk> of the , and the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there &apos;s cases of the time of <unk> .
it &apos;s a great example of what happens when governments are going to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or , or it was .
in the last autumn , it had been <unk> , because <unk> was been hacked .
somebody was hacked , and had a kind of <unk> .
and last week in a meeting , dutch <unk> , i asked the question of the group of the question , whether he had died for possible , that because of the people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a <unk> of these ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell a <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a student is required when you &apos;re a website with <unk> , for example , <unk> .
now we &apos;re using all , or many of us , gmail or a lot of their competitors , but these services are special in <unk> states like iran , where <unk> foreign forces like gmail , because they know that the local government cannot <unk> in their conversation .
but can you do , if they were in a foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and this is exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that &apos;s happened in egypt ?
now in egypt , in egypt , in egypt , the insurgent in april 2011 , the communist headquarters in the egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in this records , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , the <unk> was a local company , the egyptian government had sold some programs that they were -- in very large scale -- any communication of egyptian citizens could hold any other other .
they had sold this program for <unk> euros for the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments , governments are <unk> governments with <unk> , to take care against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , called <unk> <unk> , which was a <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you get into a <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap your internet internet .
they use tools like the <unk> , to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , to collect their <unk> .
so , if we keep thinking about things like this , the obvious answer of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t seem to me because i am a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about .
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not to debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , 2011 , our governments like trust , but we &apos;re going to be out of it forever .
and trust we , trust , we &apos;re blind to the future , a government that we may have to have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to have to do the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> were made <unk> , and <unk> &apos;s a simple idea : <unk> <unk> , which fit together .
<unk> has been very fast the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into the ability to build things that were bigger than we , building , , a stone on the other .
it &apos;s essentially the <unk> block for the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in in in , with lego , came with this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego , every household , every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that there were about 400 billion stones -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful buildings , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all .
so lego has basically the <unk> , the building the building block of the world , and then it &apos;s a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the meantime , the next year , bell labs , the next year , the next building block .
the transistor was a little <unk> <unk> that was a <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> building blocks building a world in the world that was happening was .
like the <unk> , allows us to build much greater , more complex loops , a stone on the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> , the transistor was just to experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time for experts are now and therefore decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
so a few years ago , i started developing .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> is electronic <unk> , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , the sound and the sensor .
and the best thing is that it &apos;s actually connecting with the magnet .
so they can &apos;t sit around them .
the rocks are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so all you have to do is a blue and one green onion , and they can build a very quickly larger <unk> .
you add a blue on a green green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch between between them , and they can put a little <unk> .
take the switch out to a <unk> , which is , and you &apos;ve made a little <unk> .
add this <unk> for a extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple , <unk> is actually quite powerful .
instead of , instead of coding , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to turn it up to speed , or slow , just turn on this button and it makes it a spinning faster or slow down .
the idea behind the <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a <unk> stone .
lights , sound , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> to children and play it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the beautiful thing is , as you start the electronics that surround them in the lives , and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like for example , a <unk> works , or why the the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how to respond to the <unk> of the <unk> .
we also have moved to <unk> .
so we had an example of a designer with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water bottles , like <unk> ...
a few weeks ago we have taken risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard box and paper and paper , and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my favorite <unk> .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , the fear of darkness .
for these <unk> , <unk> has been another material , electronics , and it &apos;s been just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , it &apos;s open source .
you can go to the website , all of the <unk> download and make them .
we want to encourage the world of creators , the inventor , the most enterprising , because this world is in the world , this interactive world belongs to us .
so , they go off and start invent it .
thank you .
